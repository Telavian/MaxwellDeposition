6 G H I S L A I N E M A X W E L L, called

9 follows:
10 EXAMINATION BY
11 MS. McCAWLEY:
12 Q. Good morning. I'm going to explain
13 some of the rules that will happen with
14 respect to depositions.
15 Have you ever been deposed before?
16 A. I have not.
17 Q. What is going to happen here, we
18 have a court reporter and a videographer.
19 What they do is take down the words that we
20 say so when I ask you a question they will
21 record what you say in response to that. So
22 we have to be mindful that in order for them
23 to do their job we can't talk over each
24 other.
25 Another issue you have to be weary
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 5 of 465
Page 5
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 of is that in a response, you can't give a
3 nonverbal response, in other words, nodding a
4 yes or no, they need to hear verbal response
5 so they can record it on their transcript.
6 So that's important for you to remember as we
7 go through the day. If you forget, I will be
8 sure to remind you.
9 Is there anything that would
10 prevent you from giving truthful testimony
11 today?
12 A. There is not.
13 Q. You are not on any medications or
14 anything that would inhibit your ability to
15 remember or give truthful testimony?
16 A. I am not.
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Could you identify
18 the assistant in the room.
19 MS. McCAWLEY: This is Emma Rosen
20 from our New York office. She is a
21 paralegal.
22 Q. Ms. Maxwell, can you please state
23 your address for the record?
24 A. Currently
25 Q. What is your date of birth?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 6 of 465
Page 6
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A.
3 Q. When did you first recruit a female
4 to work for Mr. Epstein?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: I object to the form
6 and foundation of the question. I
7 believe this is confidential
8 information. I ask anyone who is not
9 admitted in this case be excused from
10 the room, please.
11 MS. McCAWLEY: So the response to
12 that question would --
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: The subject matter
14 of this question is confidential and I'm
15 designating it as confidential.
16 MS. McCAWLEY: I just want to make
17 that clear for the record.
18 MR. EDWARDS: So we don't delay the
19 deposition I will step out of the room
20 but I think it's important to lay the
21 record that --
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm sorry, you are
23 not admitted in this proceeding so you
24 are not entitled to make any record. If
25 Ms. McCawley wants to make a record she
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 7 of 465
Page 7
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 can.
3 MR. EDWARDS: I can make a record
4 right now.
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Maybe we should get
6 the judge on the phone and talk about
7 it.
8 MR. EDWARDS: The record will be
9 short. This is the precise reason why
10 Ms. Giuffre wants me in this case and
11 I'm unable to effectively represent her
12 at this time because I am unable to have
13 access to the confidential information
14 which includes apparently the entire
15 deposition of Ms. Maxwell. But for the
16 sake of not further delaying this, I
17 will be outside the room.
18 MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you.
19 A. I would like to just -- wait for
20 him to leave.
21 Q. That's fine.
22 A. I would just like to clarify the
23 address. I'm in the process of selling the
24 house so while while I still receive mail
25 there, it's not my actual physical address.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 8 of 465
Page 8
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 It's in the process of being sold. It still
3 requires some final paperwork to be done, so
4 just for the purposes of clarity.
5 Q. Do you have a new address where you
6 will be living?
7 A. I do not.
8 Q. For the purpose of the record, if
9 there is something I ask you that you later
10 remember something else or need to correct
11 your testimony in some way, you can do that,
12 just let me know what it is and we will go
13 back to that question and can you clarify.
14 A. Of course. I just wanted to be
15 clear, there is still some paperwork pending
16 for final release, but it's in the process of
17 sale. But I don't have another address
18 currently, so whilst that should still be of
19 record that the mail could be forwarded
20 there, so for purposes of clarity I wanted to
21 be clear.
22 Q. I appreciate that.
23 So Ms. Maxwell, when did you first
24 recruit a female to work for Mr. Epstein?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Again. I object to
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 9 of 465
Page 9
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 form and foundation of the question.
3 Q. You can answer the question.
4 A. First of all, can you please
5 clarify the question. I don't understand
6 what you mean by female, I don't understand
7 what you mean by recruit. Please be more
8 clear and specific about what you are
9 suggesting.
10 Q. Are you a female, is that the sex
11 that you are?
12 A. I am a female.
13 Q. That's what I'm referring to a
14 female and I'm asking you when you first, the
15 very first time you recruited a female to
16 work for Mr. Epstein?
17 A. Again, I don't understand what
18 female -- I am a 54 year old women.
19 Q. I'm not making it age, any age of a
20 female that you recruited to work for Mr.
21 Epstein?
22 A. Again, I was somebody who hired a
23 number of people to work for Mr. Epstein and
24 hiring is one of my functions.
25 Q. And when is the first time you
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 10 of 465
Page 10
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 hired someone to work for Mr. Epstein, a
3 female?
4 A. As best as I can recollect, a woman
5 the age probably of about 40 or 50 was in
6 sometime in 1992.
7 Q. How long did you work for Mr.
8 Epstein?
9 A. I started working for him at some
10 point in 1992 and the nature of my work
11 relationship with him changed over time so
12 from around 2002, 2003, the work lessened
13 considerably.
14 Q. When did you --
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Can I interject for
16 a moment. If we are talking about
17 background --
18 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm in the middle of
19 a question. Let me finish it and then
20 can you interject.
21 Q. When you say 2002 to 2003 that the
22 work lessened, when did you complete working
23 for Mr. Epstein; when was the last time you
24 were employed by him, the last date?
25 A. I believe I still was doing --
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 11 of 465
Page 11
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 helping him in a very nominal way, maybe an
3 hour or two a year at sometime 2008 and 2009.
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: So if you are going
5 to be talking about general background,
6 I don't need to designate that as
7 confidential. So if you want to have
8 them come back in, that's fine.
9 I assumed by your first question
10 you were going into more sensitive
11 areas. I will leave it up to you, but
12 if this is general background it will
13 not be designated as confidential.
14 MS. McCAWLEY: I appreciate that.
15 I will jump back into my other
16 questions.
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: So we will keep it
18 as confidential.
19 Q. When you were first employed by him
20 in 1992, what were you hired to do?
21 A. First, I was consulting and what I
22 did was I helped with decorating houses and
23 in hiring staff to help run those houses.
24 Q. Did your duties change over the
25 course of 1992 to 2009?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 12 of 465
Page 12
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
3 and foundation.
4 A. My job entailed running the homes
5 that he had but much more importantly, most
6 of the houses had construction and so whilst
7 in 1992 there was no construction project,
8 there was construction projects that began
9 after that time and I was in charge not only
10 of hiring architects, I was also in charge of
11 all the filings or overseeing that, like a
12 general contractor would.
13 I also helped with hiring the
14 architects, hiring the builders, reviewing
15 the contracts for the builders, coordinating
16 the building projects, coordinating how the
17 projects would layout, the timing of the
18 projects and all the various materials that
19 they would require to run a very substantial
20 building project. That's the nature of the
21 job I was dealing with.
22 Q. How old was the youngest female you
23 ever hired to work for Jeffrey?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
25 and foundation.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 13 of 465
Page 13
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. You can answer.
3 A. I have not any idea exactly of the
4 youngest adult employee that I hired for
5 Jeffrey.
6 Q. When you say adult employee, did
7 you ever hire someone that was under the age
8 of 18?
9 A. Never.
10 Q. Did you ever bring someone who was
11 under -- invite someone under the age of 18
12 to Jeffrey's home, any of his homes?
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
14 foundation.
15 A. Can you repeat the question?
16 Q. Did you ever invite anybody who was
17 under the age of 18 to Jeffrey's homes?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objections.
19 A. I have a number of friends that
20 have children and friends of mine that have
21 kids and in the invitation of my friends and
22 their kids, I'm sure I may have invited some
23 of my friend's kids to come.
24 Q. Anybody that is not a friend of
25 yours.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 14 of 465
Page 14
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Any female under the age of 18, did
3 you invite them to come to Jeffrey's home?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
5 and foundation.
6 A. Again, as I said, I am not aware of
7 inviting anybody other than friends of mine
8 who have children to the house.
9 Q. Did you invite Virginia Giuffre to
10 come to Jeffrey Epstein's home when she was
11 under the age of 18?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
13 and foundation.
14 A. Virginia Roberts held herself out
15 as a masseuse and invited herself to come and
16 give a massage.
17 Q. My question is, did you invite
18 Virginia Roberts when she was under the age
19 of 18 to come to Jeffrey Epstein's home?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
21 and foundation.
22 A. Again, Virginia Roberts was a
23 masseuse --
24 Q. I'm asking not asking if she was a
25 masseuse. I'm asking if you invited her to
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 15 of 465
Page 15
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 come to Jeffrey Epstein's home?
3 A. Again, there would be no course to
4 have a conversation with Virginia unless she
5 held herself out to be a masseuse.
6 Q. I'm not asking that question. I'm
7 asking if you invited her to come to Jeffrey
8 Epstein's home when she was under the age of
9 18?
10 A. Again, I repeat, she was a masseuse
11 and in the form and as my job, I was to have
12 people who he wanted for various things
13 including massage. She came as a masseuse.
14 Q. So you invited her to his home to
15 come to give a massage, is that correct?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
17 and foundation. Misstates the witness'
18 testimony.
19 A. Again, I did not invite Virginia
20 Roberts. She came as a masseuse.
21 Q. She who invited her to come as a
22 masseuse, she just showed up at the front
23 door?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
25 and foundation.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 16 of 465
Page 16
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. Ms. Roberts held herself out --
3 Q. I'm not asking how she held herself
4 out. I'm asking how she arrived at the home.
5 Did you meet her and invite her to come to
6 the home or how did she arrive there?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
8 and foundation.
9 A. Ms. Roberts held her to be a
10 masseuse and her mother drove her to the
11 house.
12 Q. When did you first meet Virginia
13 Roberts?
14 A. I don't have a recollection of the
15 first meeting.
16 Q. Do you recall meeting her at
17 Mar-a-Lago?
18 A. Like I said, I don't have a
19 recollection of meeting Ms. Roberts.
20 Q. So you recall Ms. Roberts being
21 brought to the home by her mother, is that
22 your testimony?
23 A. That is my testimony.
24 Q. And that is the first time you met
25 her?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 17 of 465
Page 17
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. Like I said, I don't recall meeting
3 her the first time. I do remember her mother
4 bringing her to the house.
5 Q. Are you a member at Mar-a-Lago?
6 A. No.
7 Q. Have you visited Mar-a-Lago?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Did you visit Mar-a-Lago in the
10 year 2000?
11 A. I'm pretty sure I did.
12 Q. When Ms. Roberts arrived at the
13 home with her mother, what happened?
14 A. I spoke to her mother outside of
15 the house and she -- what I don't recall is
16 exactly what happened because I was talking
17 to her mother the entire she was in the
18 house.
19 Q. Did you introduce Ms. Roberts to
20 Jeffrey Epstein?
21 A. I don't recall how she actually met
22 Mr. Epstein. As I said, I spoke to her
23 mother the entire time outside the house.
24 Q. Did you walk Ms. Roberts up to the
25 upstairs location at the Palm Beach house to
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 18 of 465
Page 18
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 meet Mr. Epstein?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
4 and foundation.
5 Q. You can answer.
6 A. I just explained.
7 A. I spent the entire time talking to
8 Virginia's mother outside the house so the
9 answer to the question is no.
10 Q. No, did you not walk her up and
11 introduce her to Mr. Epstein?
12 A. I just said no.
13 Q. Did you participate in a massage
14 this first time when she first came to the
15 home and you were speaking with her mother,
16 she was in the home, is that correct, you
17 brought her into the home?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
19 and foundation.
20 A. I will repeat again, I was standing
21 outside with her mother so very difficult for
22 me to do anything else at that time so no, I
23 did not take her upstairs.
24 Q. Did you participate --
25 A. Virginia lied 100 percent about
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 19 of 465
Page 19
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 absolutely everything that took place in that
3 first meeting. She has lied repeatedly,
4 often and is just an awful fantasist. So
5 very difficult for anything to take place
6 that she repeated because I was with her
7 mother the entire time.
8 Q. So did you have -- did you give a
9 massage with Virginia Roberts and Mr. Epstein
10 during the first time Virginia Roberts was at
11 the West Palm Beach house?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
13 and foundation.
14 Q. Yes or no?
15 A. No.
16 Q. Have you ever given a massage with
17 Virginia Roberts in the room and Jeffrey
18 Epstein?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
20 and foundation.
21 A. No.
22 Q. Have you ever given Jeffrey Epstein
23 a massage?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form,
25 foundation. And I'm going to instruct
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 20 of 465
Page 20
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 you not to answer that question. I
3 don't have any problem with you asking
4 questions about what the subject matter
5 of this lawsuit is, which would be, as
6 you've termed it, sexual trafficking of
7 Ms. Roberts.
8 To the extent you are asking for
9 information relating to any consensual
10 adult interaction between my client and
11 Mr. Epstein, I'm going to instruct her
12 not to answer because it's not part of
13 this litigation and it is her private
14 confidential information, not subject to
15 this deposition.
16 MS. McCAWLEY: You can instruct her
17 not to answer. That is your right. But
18 I will bring her back for another
19 deposition because it is part of the
20 subject matter of this litigation so she
21 should be answering these questions.
22 This is civil litigation, deposition and
23 she should be responsible for answering
24 these questions.
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: I disagree and you
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 21 of 465
Page 21
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 understand the bounds that I put on it.
3 MS. McCAWLEY: No, I don't. I will
4 continue to ask my questions and you can
5 continue to make your objections.
6 Q. Did you ever participate from the
7 time period of 1992 to 2009, did you ever
8 participate in a massage with Jeffrey Epstein
9 and another female?
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection. Do not
11 answer that question. Again, to the
12 extent you are asking for some sort of
13 illegal activity as you've construed in
14 connection with this case I don't have
15 any problem with you asking that
16 question. To the extent these questions
17 involve consensual acts between adults,
18 frankly, they're none of your business
19 and I will instruct the witness not to
20 answer.
21 MS. McCAWLEY: This case involves
22 sexual trafficking, sexual abuse,
23 questions about her having interactions
24 with other females is relevant to this
25 case. She needs to answer these
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 22 of 465
Page 22
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 questions.
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm instructing her
4 not to answer.
5 MS. McCAWLEY: Then we will be back
6 here again.
7 Q. Have you ever given a massage to
8 Mr. Epstein with a female that was under the
9 age of 18?
10 A. Can you repeat the question?
11 Q. Yes. Have you ever given a massage
12 to Mr. Epstein with a female that was under
13 the age of 18?
14 A. No.
15 Q. Have you ever observed Mr. Epstein
16 having a massage given by an individual, a
17 female, who was under the age of 18?
18 A. No.
19 Q. Have you ever observed females
20 under the age of 18 in the presence of
21 Jeffrey Epstein at his home?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
23 and foundation.
24 A. Again, I have friends that have
25 children --
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 23 of 465
Page 23
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. I'm not talking about friends. I'm
3 talking about individuals --
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm going to object
5 to you interrupting the witness who was
6 answering your question. The question
7 was, have you ever seen anyone, female
8 under the age of 18 at the house and
9 that's the question she was answering.
10 If you want to strike that question and
11 ask another question, feel free, but let
12 the witness respond, please.
13 MS. McCAWLEY: I will do that.
14 Q. Have you ever observed a female
15 under the age of 18 at Jeffrey Epstein's home
16 that was not a friend, a child -- one of your
17 friend's children?
18 A. Again, I can't testify to that
19 because I have no idea what you are talking
20 about.
21 Q. You have no idea what I'm talking
22 about in the sense you never observed a
23 female under the age of 18 at Jeffrey
24 Epstein's home that was not one of your
25 friend's children, is that correct?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 24 of 465
Page 24
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
3 and foundation.
4 A. How would I possibly know how
5 someone is when they are at his house. You
6 are asking me to do that. I cannot possibly
7 testify to that. As far as I'm concerned,
8 everyone who came to his house was an adult
9 professional person.
10 Q. Are you familiar with the police
11 report that was issued in respect to the
12 investigation in this matter?
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
14 and foundation.
15 Q. Are you familiar with the police
16 report that was used in this matter, the
17 investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, has been
18 produced as a document in this matter?
19 A. I have seen a police report.
20 (Maxwell Exhibit 1, police report,
21 marked for identification.)
22 Q. The police report that you have in
23 front of you, can you turn to page 28 of that
24 report, the numbers are on the top right-hand
25 corner.

2 You will see some redactions in
3 this report, Ms. Maxwell, the redacted
4 information is redacted because it reveals
5 the name of a minor, someone who is under the
6 age of 18.
7 On page 28, in the third paragraph,
8 about halfway down, it says, stated
9 she performed the massage naked. At the
10 conclusion of this massage, Epstein paid
11 $200 for the massage. He explained, I
12 know you are not comfortable put I will pay
13 you if you bring some girls. He told her the
14 younger the better. stated once tried
15 to bring a 23 year old to Epstein and he
16 stated the female was too old.
17 Have you heard Mr. Epstein use the
18 phrase the younger the better?
19 A. I have no recollection of hearing
20 that.
21 Q. Have you used the phrase in talking
22 to and asking her to recruit
23 females for Mr. Epstein, the younger the
24 better?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 26 of 465

2 and foundation of the question.
3 A. First of all, can you break the
4 question apart.
5 Q. Have you used the phrase the
6 younger the better in speaking to
7 and asking her to recruit females for Jeffrey
8 Epstein?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
10 and foundation.
11 Q. You can answer. It's yes or no.
12 A. No, that's absolutely not true, on
13 the second part of your question, I have not
14 asked Virginia to recruit females and the
15 first part of your question, if you can
16 repeat that again, the question you asked.
17 Q. Will you read back the question.
18 (Record read.)
19 A. I believe I answered the later part
20 of the question. The first part of the
21 question, it's impossible for me to recall
22 events that took place 16 years ago but it
23 doesn't sound like something I would say.
24 Q. On page 28, that same paragraph,
25 was asked how many girls in total she
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 27 of 465
Page 27
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 brought to Epstein. stated that she
3 can remember, stated that she brought
4 and, it's redacted there, and the victim in
5 this case.
6 Let me ask my question, I have a
7 question pending right now.
8 Are you testifying that you are
9 unaware of any underage, under the age of 18,
10 females coming to Jeffrey Epstein's home to
11 perform massages?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
13 foundation.
14 A. You need to straddle that question
15 in a different time period. When I was
16 there, at the time I was present, the people
17 that gave Jeffrey, men and women who gave
18 Jeffrey massages were adults over the age of
19 18.
20 Q. Never in your time at any of
21 Jeffrey Epstein's homes were you present when
22 a female under the age of 18 was there to
23 give Jeffrey Epstein a massage?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
25 and foundation.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 28 of 465
Page 28
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. First of all, as I said when I was
3 present --
4 Q. It is a yes or no.
5 A. No, it is not.
6 Q. You can answer the question in full
7 but please provide yes or no as an initial
8 matter.
9 A. I cannot answer yes or no, it's not
10 bounded by time. It's entirely possible I
11 could have been in a room or even in the
12 vicinity of Palm beach when somebody came and
13 I would not know. How would I know when
14 somebody was in the house. There is no way I
15 can know.
16 Q. Did you stay at Jeffrey Epstein's
17 home when you were in Palm Beach?
18 A. Most of the time.
19 Q. So how is it that you wouldn't know
20 if there was a female in the home under the
21 age of 18 if you were staying there?
22 A. Well, first of all, when I was
23 staying there, the house is actually quite
24 large and I have a very busy job and I had an
25 office with a door so the door would be shut
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 29 of 465
Page 29
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 and I would be working. I'm not responsible
3 for what Jeffrey does and I don't always pay
4 attention to what happens in the house. I'm
5 very busy.
6 Q. So you're testifying that you never
7 observed a female under the age of 18 at
8 Jeffrey Epstein's West Palm Beach home?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
10 and foundation.
11 A. I already answered that question, I
12 believe.
13 Q. You didn't answer my question.
14 A. I did.
15 Q. Did you observe a female under the
16 age of 18 at Jeffrey Epstein's home in Palm
17 Beach?
18 A. Like I said, I work, I don't sit
19 there and watch people coming in and out of
20 the house. I cannot possibly tell you if I'm
21 in the home that somebody was there that I
22 did not see, I cannot comment on it, I have
23 no idea.
24 Q. Did you observe females at Jeffrey
25 Epstein's home that were laying out topless
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 30 of 465
Page 30
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 in the back of the home, in other words
3 without a shirt on?
4 A. So that's just another of
5 Virginia's lies. So let's be clear, at the
6 time when I was there and present, frequently
7 at the house, it was unusual to see people
8 without their clothes on.
9 Q. When you say unusual, did you
10 observe people without their clothes at
11 Jeffrey Espstein's home?
12 A. Can I answer. Sometimes people in
13 the privacy of a house and swimming pool, I
14 have seen people from time to time take their
15 top off. I have seen people from time to
16 time do that. Very unusual. Naked people
17 around the people at any frequent period of
18 time, I have never seen.
19 Q. Were they under the age of 18?
20 A. As I was saying, people when I was
21 in the house, were of adult age, if they were
22 children, friends of my family or friends
23 that were there, they may well have been
24 because I have nieces and nephews under the
25 age of 18, I cannot testify to anybody else
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 31 of 465
Page 31
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 -- just another one of Virginia's many
3 fictitious lies and stories to make this a
4 salacious event to get interest and press.
5 It's absolute rubbish.
6 Q. Were you in charge of hiring
7 individuals to provide massages for Jeffrey
8 Epstein?
9 A. My job included hiring many people.
10 There were six homes. As I sit here, I hired
11 assistants, I hired architects, I hired
12 decorators, I hired cooks, I hired cleaners,
13 I hired gardeners, I hired pool people, I
14 hired pilots, I hired all sorts of people.
15 In the course and a very small part
16 of my job was from from time to time to find
17 adult professional massage therapists for
18 Jeffrey.
19 Q. When you say adult professional
20 massage therapists, where did you find these
21 massage therapists?
22 A. From time to time I would visit
23 professional spas, I would receive a massage
24 and if the massage was good I would ask that
25 man or woman if they did home visits.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 32 of 465
Page 32
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. Did you ever hire a masseuse that
3 was under the age of 18?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
5 and foundation.
6 Q. Did you?
7 A. Again, I don't hire massage
8 therapists, so that was not my job.
9 Q. You just said you did, you just
10 said you hired massage therapists for Jeffrey
11 Epstein, I'm asking if you hired a massage
12 therapist who was under the age of 18?
13 A. Let me correct myself. When I
14 meant hire, I didn't mean hire in the way you
15 are doing it. What I say is that I went to
16 spas and I met people and if they did home
17 visits, Jeffrey would then, in fact, hire
18 them. I'm not responsible for hiring
19 someone. And they were not full-time, so
20 it's not a correct characterization.
21 Q. Did you ever, your term is meet,
22 did you ever meet a person that was under the
23 age of 18 that you -- that Jeffrey then hired
24 as a masseuse?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 33 of 465
Page 33
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 and foundation.
3 A. First of all, Virginia Roberts who
4 you are referring to was a masseuse aged 17,
5 we all now know, so your story that you keep
6 pushing out to the press that she was a 15
7 year old -- you and I both know was a lie,
8 correct.
9 Q. You are not sentencing my question.
10 A. You and I both know that was a lie,
11 correct.
12 Q. You are not answering my question.
13 I'm asking you whether you ever met a female
14 under the age of 18 that Jeffrey then hired
15 as a masseuse?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
17 and foundation.
18 A. The only person I can talk about
19 who clearly was a massage age 17, a masseuse,
20 was Virginia.
21 Q. Did you meet her and then introduce
22 her to Jeffrey?
23 A. I don't know. I already testified
24 I don't recall meeting her.
25 (Maxwell Exhibit 2, email, marked
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 34 of 465
Page 34
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 for identification.)
3 Q. So I'm showing you a document that
4 we have marked as Maxwell Exhibit 2. It's a
5 document you produced in this matter labeled
6 confidential GM 00109. It's dated Sunday
7 June 12, 2011. It's from Jeffrey Epstein to
8 you. If you can turn to page 4 -- sorry, can
9 you turn to the first page, the cover page
10 initially which is 00109. If you look under
11 the time stamp it says, June 12, 2011 at 4:12
12 p.m., it says
13 Is that your email address?
14 A. It is.
15 Q. Under that it says, Thank you. I
16 have it now and I'm working on a letter, a
17 little, I will send the final version
18 tomorrow and what ever it is will be
19 factually accurate.
20 Do you see that on page 1?
21 A. I do.
22 Q. Then I would like you to turn to
23 page 4 please. The second paragraph down on
24 page 4, it states, After some thought, I
25 recall that I first met Ms. Roberts when she
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 35 of 465
Page 35
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 was working at a premier resort claiming to
3 be 18 years old and a professional masseuse?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: What line are you
5 on, counsel.
6 MS. McCAWLEY: Second paragraph
7 down.
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: I got it.
9 Q. Is that a statement that you wrote?
10 A. It appears to be.
11 Q. So does that correct your testimony
12 that you did meet Ms. Roberts at Mar-a-Lago?
13 A. Again, this was written in, when
14 were you saying?
15 Q. 2011.
16 A. So by 2011, Ms. Roberts had already
17 perpetrated so many lies and stories it's
18 hard for me to accurately tell you today what
19 I remember back then. As I sit here today,
20 the testimony I give you today, I do not
21 recollect it.
22 Q. Do you have a reason to say that
23 this document that you wrote is incorrect?
24 A. It's in 2011, I can't possibly tell
25 you what I remember in 2011.

Page 36
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. Are you questioning that this
3 document is incorrect, this document -- this
4 email that you wrote?
5 A. I wrote an email. I was trying to
6 be accurate, so who knows, with all the
7 rubbish that you guys have put out in the
8 press that I read, maybe in the moment I
9 wrote it a memory came to me that I don't
10 know, but as I sit here today and the
11 testimony I gave you today is I don't
12 recollect it.
13 Q. Does this refresh your recollection
14 that you recalled meeting Ms. Roberts at
15 Mar-a-Lago?
16 A. It does not.
17 Q. So your testimony today is that you
18 don't remember meeting Ms. Roberts at
19 Mar-a-Lago?
20 A. I do not.
21 I just want to clarify, when you
22 read so much stuff and so much rubbish that
23 comes out from Virginia Roberts, you don't
24 know what's up and down, at the time I wrote
25 this I believe I had a memory but as I sit

13 when you first met her?
14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form

7 Q. When you say girls like that, what

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form

10 A. No.
11 Q. Did she look like she was under the

22 her on Jeffrey Epstein's planes, did you ever
23 ask her how old she was?

3 she doesn't remember.
4 Q. You can answer that question.
5 Did you ever ask her on the many
6 flights you were with her or the many times
7 you were with her at the house?
8 A. First of all, I don't know I was on
9 many flights with her, you are making stories
10 up again as usual. And secondly, if I was on
11 a flight with her, there would not be any
12 reason why I would ask her how old she was.
13 Q. You don't recollect having any
14 conversation with her about her age?
15 A. I already testified to that.
16 Q. Do you know what
17 was hired to do for Jeffrey?

19 around 7, 8, $9 and as a professional
20 healthcare provider you can earn somewhere
21 between as we have established 100 to $200
22 and to be able to travel and have a job that

2 about.
3 Q. So you didn't provide her with
4 that?
5 A. As I just testified, I have no idea
6 what you are talking about.
7 Q. I was trying to interpret whether
8 you didn't understand what a school girl
9 outfit was or you are saying that didn't
10 happen?
11 A. I clearly know what a school girl
12 outfit is. I have no recollection of
13 providing anybody with a school girl outfit.
14 Q. Did you have a set of outfits used
15 by the massage therapists that would include
16 things like a school girl outfit or a black
17 patent leather outfit or anything of that

22 Q. Do you recollect having sex toys at

2 situation.
3 Q. Did you ever participate in sex
4 with Virginia Roberts and Jeffrey Epstein?
5 A. I never ever at any single time at
6 any point ever at all participated in
7 anything with Virginia and Jeffrey. And for
8 the record, she is an absolute total liar and
9 you all know she lied on multiple things and
10 that is just one other disgusting thing she
11 added.
12 Q. Did you help her obtain an
13 apartment in Palm Beach to live in?
14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
15 form and foundation.
16 Q. Was that part of your
17 responsibilities for Jeffrey?
18 A. First of all, I didn't know she had
19 an apartment in Palm Beach. I only learned
20 that from the many times you guys have gone
21 to the press to sell stories, so no.
22 Q. Did you help her get a cell phone,
23 was that one of your responsibilities for

Page 77
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
3 form and foundation.
4 A. I don't know what that means,
5 masseuse obligation, I don't know what you
6 are referring to. Would you like to ask the
7 question properly?
8 Q. I think it was proper. I will ask
9 it again.

14 anything of that nature.
15 Q. Did you ever tell Virginia that you
16 wanted her to have a cell phone so that she

Page 78
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 over to the house in Palm Beach to give
3 massages?
4 A. It's important to understand that I
5 wasn't with Jeffrey all the time. In fact, I
6 was only in the house less than half the
7 time, so I cannot testify to when I wasn't in
8 the house how often she came when I wasn't
9 there.
10 What I can say is that I barely
11 would remember her, if not for all of this
12 rubbish, I probably wouldn't remember her at
13 all, except she did come from time to time
14 but I don't recollect her coming as often as
15 she portrayed herself.
16 Q. How many times a day on an average
17 day would Jeffrey Epstein get a massage?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
19 form and foundation.
20 A. When I was at the house and when I
21 was there with him, he received a massage, on
22 average, about once a day.
23 Q. Just once?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Were there days when he received
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 79 of 465
Page 79
1 G Maxwell - Confidential

6 never saw something like that.
7 Q. Do you know if Virginia was
8 required to be on call at all times to come
9 to the house if Jeffrey wanted her there?

13 that Virginia made with Jeffrey.
14 Q. When Virginia was in New York,

Page 80
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 all, except for this story.
3 Q. Do you recall Virginia Roberts
4 calling you because she was having a medical
5 crisis and you and Jeffrey taking her to the
6 hospital?
7 A. I have heard this absurd story and
8 if any part of it were true I would remember
9 that. I do not.
10 Q. You don't remember taking her to
11 the hospital?
12 A. It's not that I don't remember it,
13 it didn't happen.
14 Q. How do you know it didn't happen?
15 A. That's the sort of memory you would
16 recall.
17 Q. Do you recall, you said you don't
18 remember her being at the New York mansion.
19 When you were in New York would you stay at
20 the New York mansion with Jeffrey?
21 A. I stayed from time to time.
22 Q. Do you recall Virginia being at the
23 New York mansion when came to

4 being at the house at all.
5 Q. How many homes does Jeffrey have?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
7 form and foundation.
8 A. When I was working for him, I think
9 he had six maybe.
10 Q. Would Virginia stay with him in
11 those homes?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation.
14 A. I can only testify for when I was
15 present with him and I cannot say what she
16 did when I wasn't present with him.
17 Q. When you were present, would
18 Virginia stay in the homes with him?
19 A. I don't recall her staying in the
20 houses.
21 Q. Did you train Virginia on how to
22 recruit other girls for massages?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
24 form and foundation.
25 A. No.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 82 of 465
Page 82
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. Did you train Virginia on how to
3 recruit other girls to perform sexual
4 massages?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
6 form and foundation.
7 A. No. And it's absurd and her entire
8 story is one giant tissue of lies and
9 furthermore, she herself has -- if she says
10 that, you have to ask her about what she did.
11 Q. Does Jeffrey like to have his
12 nipples pinched during sexual encounters?
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
14 and foundation.
15 A. I'm not referring to any advice on
16 my counsel. I'm not talking about any adult
17 sexual things when I was with him.
18 Q. When Jeffrey would have a massage,
19 would he request that the masseuse pinch his
20 nipples while he was having a massage?
21 A. I'm not talking about anything with
22 consensual adult situation.
23 Q. What about with underage --
24 A. I am not aware of anything.
25 Q. You are not aware of Jeffrey
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 83 of 465
Page 83
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Epstein ever having sex with an underage
3 minor and asking them to pinch his nipples?
4 A. I am not.
5 Q. So I'm going to direct you to, I
6 believe it's Maxwell Exhibit 1, the police
7 report.
8 Are you aware that over 30 under
9 age minors gave testimony to police that they
10 were engaged in sexual acts during,
11 quote-unquote, massages.
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: The witness needs to
13 find Exhibit 1. Exhibit 1 -- if you can
14 hand me that please.
15 Q. So now with respect to the police
16 report, are you aware that over 30 underage
17 girls, meaning under the age of 18 gave
18 reports to police that they were assaulted
19 sexually by Jeffrey Epstein during massages?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. I read the police report. That's
23 all I can testify to.
24 Q. Are you aware of what is in the
25 police report? Are you aware that there were
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 84 of 465
Page 84
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 30 girls --
3 A. I did not count the number of girls
4 and I did read the police report. I can only
5 testify to what I read.
6 Q. So you are aware that the police
7 report contains reports from 30 underage
8 girls?
9 A. I can't testify to what the girls
10 said. I can only testify to the fact that I
11 read a police report that stated that.
12 Q. Were you working for Jeffrey -- you
13 said you worked for him off an on until 2009,
14 is that correct?
15 A. I helped out from time to time.
16 Q. So you were working with him during
17 the time period when these underage girls
18 were visiting Jeffrey's home?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
20 form and foundation.
21 A. I was not -- what year, I need
22 years.
23 Q. How about let's say 2005?
24 A. I'm not sure I was at the house at
25 all in 2005, maybe one day, maybe.

3 A. I was present for his mother's --
4 his mother died in 2004 so I was there for

6 at the house maybe a handful of days, again.
7 Q. I would like to direct you to, you
8 have it pulled together now, it's page 39,
9 Bates stamped Giuffre 00040?
10 A. Can you repeat that, please.
11 Q. Sure. 00040.
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. At the top of that document, about
14 three lines down, you see the redacted
15 portions where there is black so it blacks
16 out the name.
17 A. I see black redacted portions.
18 Q. That's a black redaction of the
19 name of the minor and there is -- I will
20 represent for the record that's what it is.
21 You can contest that but I'm not asking about
22 the name of the minor.
23 Five lines down, it says, She was
24 just 16 years of age.
25 Do you see that?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 86 of 465
Page 86
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. I have to read that, if you want me
3 to testify to some things.
4 Q. I'm asking if you see where it
5 says, She was just 16 years old.
6 A. No, I have to read it.
7 Q. It's five line downs on the first
8 paragraph.
9 A. I do see that.
10 Q. Then the next paragraph down, it
11 says, this is the next full paragraph, it
12 says, Epstein entered the room, introduced
13 himself, Epstein lay on the table and told
14 her to get comfortable, blank could not
15 remember if he was naked or if he entered the
16 room with a towel. Blank stated she provided
17 the massage wearing her panties. She
18 continued rubbing his thighs and feet. Blank
19 advised he turned over on his back and
20 continued to rub his legs with oil. Epstein
21 touched her breast and began to masturbate.
22 I asked if she knew what circumcised and
23 uncircumcised meant. She stated circumcised
24 is when the penis had no foreskin.
25 Then jumping down to the next
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 87 of 465
Page 87
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 paragraph, it says, Blank became upset,
3 crying hysterically and stated she was paid
4 and also instructed to have sex with Epstein
5 and by Epstein.
6 Do you see that there?
7 A. I do.
8 Q. Are you aware that there were
9 underage minors in the Palm Beach house that
10 were required to give sexual massages to
11 Jeffrey Epstein?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation. This has been
14 asked and answered already. Now you are
15 just reading a document.
16 MS. McCAWLEY: I am allowed to take
17 this deposition.
18 A. I already testified --
19 Q. Are you aware there were underage
20 girls, 30 of them, in this police report that
21 were assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein in the Palm
22 Beach house during the time you are working
23 there?
24 A. I am aware that Virginia has
25 lied repeatedly --
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 88 of 465
Page 88
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. I'm not asking about Virginia. I'm
3 asking if you are aware that there were over
4 30 underage girls who gave reports to police
5 officers during the time you worked for
6 Jeffrey Epstein. Are you aware of that?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Counsel, what is
8 your factual basis for asserting there
9 are 30 underaged people who gave
10 reports?
11 MS. McCAWLEY: I don't have to
12 answer that.
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Are you representing
14 as an officer of the court that you have
15 personal knowledge that there are 30
16 people referenced in these police
17 reports?
18 MS. McCAWLEY: That's my
19 understanding, that there are 30 girls.
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: How is that your
21 understanding if these are redacted
22 reports?
23 MS. McCAWLEY: By reading through
24 the reports.
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: So you have personal
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 89 of 465
Page 89
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 knowledge there are 30 people --
3 MS. McCAWLEY: Just like can you if
4 you read through -- I will not argue
5 with you counsel.. she can answer yes or
6 no.
7 Q. Are you aware there were over 30
8 individuals who were minors who gave reports
9 to police just like the one we just read that
10 they were sexually assaulted by Jeffrey
11 Epstein in the Palm Beach home during the
12 years that you were working with him?
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
14 form and foundation. You can answer if
15 you have knowledge.
16 A. I already testified I was limited
17 in the house, a couple of days, there is no
18 way I knew. I have read these reports. I
19 cannot testify to 30. Given the experience
20 I've had with Virginia's lies, it's very hard
21 for me to testify about what I see. I can
22 tell from you my personal knowledge I did not
23 know what you are referring to.
24 Q. You did not know there were
25 underage girls in the home that were being
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 90 of 465
Page 90
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein during the time
3 you were working there?
4 A. Based on the lies that I have
5 already been told, I cannot comment on any --
6 Q. Are you saying these 30 girls are
7 lying when they gave these reports to police
8 officers?
9 A. I'm not testifying to their lies.
10 I'm testifying to Virginia's lies.
11 Q. I am not asking about Virginia's
12 lies.
13 A. I can only testify to Virginia's
14 lies. I can testify to having read these
15 reports. I cannot testify to anything else
16 about them.
17 Q. So your testimony is that during
18 the time you were working there, you did not
19 know that these minor children were being
20 abused in the home while you were there?
21 A. What I have already told you and I
22 will repeat, I was in the house very limited
23 times, very few times. I do not know what
24 you are referring to. I've read these
25 reports but based on the lies that Virginia
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 91 of 465
Page 91
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 has perpetrated, cannot tell you what is true
3 or factual or not.
4 Q. You said you were in the home a
5 very limited time, so average in the year for
6 example, 2004, how many times would you have
7 been in his Palm Beach home?
8 A. Very hard for me to state but very
9 little.
10 Q. How about his New York home?
11 A. Same.
12 Q. Were you his girlfriend in that
13 year, in 2004?
14 A. Define what you mean by girlfriend.
15 Q. Were you in a relationship with him
16 where you would consider yourself his
17 girlfriend?
18 A. No.
19 Q. Did you ever consider yourself his
20 girlfriend?
21 A. That's a tricky question. There
22 were times when I would have liked to think
23 of myself as his girlfriend.
24 Q. When would that have been?
25 A. Probably in the early '90s.

2 Q. In your responsibilities in working
3 for Jeffrey, would you book massages for him
4 on any given day so that he would have a
5 massage scheduled? Would you take a call for
6 example and book a massage for him?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
8 form and foundation.
9 Q. You can answer.
10 A. Typically, that was not my
11 responsibility. He would either book the
12 massage himself or one of his other
13 assistants would do that.
14 Q. From time to time you had to do
15 that?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
17 form and foundation.
18 A. Like I said, typically it was
19 somebody else's responsibility.
20 Q. If you were unable to book a girl
21 for a massage on a given day, would that mean
22 that you were responsible for giving him a
23 sexual massage?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
25 form and foundation and I instruct you
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 93 of 465

2 not to answer any questions about any of
3 your consensual adult sexual activity.
4 Q. So you are not going to answer that
5 question?
6 A. You just heard my counsel.
7 Q. Have you ever said to anybody that
8 recruiting other girls to perform sexual
9 massages for Jeffrey Epstein takes the
10 pressure off you?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
12 and foundation.
13 A. Repeat the question and break it
14 out.
15 Q. Have you ever said to anybody that
16 you recruit girls --
17 A. Stop right there. I never
18 recruited girls, let's stop there. Now
19 breakdown the question.
20 Q. Have you ever said to anybody --
21 A. By girls, we are talking about
22 underage people -- you said girls, are you
23 talking about underage -- we are not talking
24 about consensual acts -- this is a defamation
25 suit.

2 Q. I'm asking the questions. I know
3 what this case is about. I'm trying to -- I
4 will ask you questions if you don't
5 understand the question I can break it down
6 for you. I'm happy to do that.
7 A. Break it down a lot please.
8 Q. I will do that.
9 The question is, have you ever said
10 to anybody that you recruit other girls --
11 A. Why don't you stop there.
12 Q. Let me finish my question.
13 Have you ever said to anybody that
14 you recruit girls to take the pressure off
15 you, so you won't have to have sex with
16 Jeffrey, have you said that?
17 That's the question?
18 A. You don't ask me questions like
19 that. First of all, you are trying to trap
20 me, I will not be trapped. You are asking me
21 if I recruit, I told you no. Girls meaning
22 underage, I already said I don't do that with
23 underage people and as to ask me about a
24 specific conversation I had with language, we
25 talking about almost 17 years ago when this
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 95 of 465
Page 95
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 took place. I cannot testify to an actual
3 conversation or language that I used with
4 anybody at any time.
5 Q. Have you ever said to anybody that
6 you recruit other females over the age of 18
7 to take the pressure off you to having to
8 have sex with Jeffrey?
9 A. I totally resent and find it
10 disgusting that you use the word recruit. I
11 already told you I don't know what you are
12 saying about that and your implication is
13 repulsive.
14 Q. Answer my question.
15 A. I just did.
16 Q. Have you ever said to anybody that
17 you recruit females --
18 A. I don't recruit anybody.
19 Q. That's an answer. So you never
20 said that?
21 A. I'm testifying that I cannot
22 testify to an actual language --
23 Q. It's a yes or no.
24 A. I will not testify to an actual
25 statement made 17 years ago, so I cannot
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 96 of 465
Page 96
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 testify to actual language.
3 Q. So you won't testify to anything
4 I'm asking you 17 years ago about a statement
5 you made. How do you know it's 17 years ago?
6 A. We are talking about a time in
7 2000, right?
8 Q. Have you ever said that to anybody?
9 A. I'm 54 years old so you are asking
10 me in my entire life, what words are you
11 asking me in my entire life?
12 Q. Your entire life is limited by the
13 time you were with Jeffrey, this is the
14 question.
15 A. Let's time limit the question you
16 are asking me.
17 Q. So from, let's say, I think you
18 said you started with him in 1992, is that
19 correct, and finished with him in 2009.
20 So from 1992 to 2009 have you ever
21 said to anybody that you recruit other and we
22 will start with girls to take the pressure
23 off you to have sex with Jeffrey?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
25 form and foundation.

Page 97
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. First of all I resent and despise
3 the world recruit. Would you like to define
4 what you mean by recruit and by girls, you
5 mean underage people. I never had to do
6 anything with underage people. So why don't
7 you reask the question in a way that I am
8 able to answer it.
9 Q. I'm asking if you ever said that to
10 anybody. So if you don't understand the word
11 recruit and you never used that word then the
12 answer to that question would be no.
13 A. I have no memory as I sit here
14 today having used that word.
15 Q. Did you ever meet an underage girl
16 in London to introduce her to Jeffrey to
17 provide him with a massage?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
19 form and foundation.
20 A. Run that past me one more time.
21 Q. Did you ever meet an underage girl
22 in London to introduce her to Jeffrey to
23 perform a massage?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objection.
25 A. Are you asking me if I met anybody
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 98 of 465
Page 98
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 that was underage in London specifically to
3 provide a massage to Jeffrey, is that your
4 question?
5 Q. Yes.
6 A. No.
7 Q. Do you know who is?
8 A. I don't recall her right now.
9 Q. Do you know if -- strike that.
10 During the time that you were
11 working for Jeffrey, did you ever observe any
12 foreign females, so in other words, not from
13 the United States, that were brought to
14 Jeffrey's home to perform massages?
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
16 form and foundation.
17 A. Females, what age are we talking?
18 Q. Any age.
19 A. Can you repeat the question?
20 Q. During the time you were working
21 for Jeffrey, did you ever observe any foreign
22 females of any age that were at Jeffrey's
23 home to perform a massage?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
25 form and foundation.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 99 of 465
Page 99
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. Are you asking me if any foreigner,
3 not an American person, gave Jeffrey a
4 massage?
5 Q. Yes.
6 A. Well, as I sit here today, I can't
7 think of anyone who is foreign. Certainly --
8 I just can't think of anybody right this
9 second.
10 Q. How about any foreign girls who
11 were under the age of 18?
12 A. I already testified to not knowing
13 anything about underage girls.
14 Q. Were there foreign girls who were
15 brought to Jeffrey's home by
16 for the purposes of providing massages?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
18 form and foundation.
19 A. I am not aware of bringing
20 girls. I have not no idea what you are
21 talking about.
22 Q. You have never been around foreign
23 girls who are under the age of 18 at
24 Jeffrey's homes?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 100 of 465

2 form and foundation.
3 A. I already testified about not
4 knowing about underage girls.
5 Q. Did you provide any assistance with
6 obtaining visas for foreign girls that were
7 under the age of 18?
8 A. I've never participated in helping
9 people of any age to get visas.
10 Q. Did Jeffrey, was it Jeffrey's
11 preference to start a massage with sex?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation.
14 A. I think you should ask that
15 question of Jeffrey.
16 Q. Do you know?
17 A. I don't believe that was his
18 preference. I think -- you have to
19 understand, a massage -- perhaps you are not
20 really familiar with what massage is.
21 Q. I am, I don't need a lecture on
22 massage.
23 A. I think you do.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: No question pending.
25 She will ask you another question now.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 101 of 465

6 A. No.
7 Q. How were you introduced to Jeffrey?

10 back in 1991, was it friendship or was it

13 1991?
14 A. It was just friendly.
15 Q. Then I believe you testified you
16 began working for him in 1992, is that
17 correct?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. In 1992 I know you gave me the
20 description of the work that you were
21 performing for him, how much was he paying
22 you, do you remember?
23 A. I don't recall.
24 Q. Do you know for example in 2001 how
25 much he was paying you?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 102 of 465
Page 102
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. I don't recall.
3 Q. Did it change over the years or did
4 the payment remain the same?
5 A. I believe over the course of time
6 it increased a little bit.
7 Q. Was that the -- was that payment
8 the payment that -- was the payment made with
9 respect to the jobs, the work you were
10 performing for Jeffrey, was that your sole
11 income at that time?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: I object to the
13 form. I'm also going to instruct you
14 not to answer about sources of -- your
15 personal sources of income outside of
16 Mr. Epstein at all.
17 MS. McCAWLEY: What's the basis for
18 that?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: It's confidential,
20 it's not part of this lawsuit.
21 MS. McCAWLEY: We have a protective
22 order and it is part of this lawsuit
23 with respect to our damage claims.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: It's not and, in
25 fact, you are not entitled to ask
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 103 of 465
Page 103
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 financial information of a defendant in
3 this kind of case, in a defamation case
4 unless and until there is a finding that
5 you are entitled to punitive damages.
6 That is clear in New York case law, both
7 state and Federal.
8 MS. McCAWLEY: We disagree on that
9 point and we will come back to that.
10 Q. From the source of payment from the
11 source of Jeffrey, from your work, can you
12 give me a range on that, do you know was it
13 over $100,000?
14 A. I just testified I don't recall.
15 Q. You don't don't know if it was
16 $500,000?

18 Q. Somewhere between 100 and 500,
19 would that be fair to say?
20 A. I believe it was between 100 and
21 $200,000.
22 Q. Did Jeffrey during the time that
23 you were working for him purchase a town home
24 for you?
25 A. The subject of the townhouse is, I

Page 104

2 worked for it and I had a loan, we did loans.
3 Q. So a loan through Jeffrey?
4 A. I don't recall the exact
5 transaction.
6 Q. Did he purchase for you a
7 helicopter during the time you were working
8 for him?
9 A. It was his helicopter.
10 Q. When did you obtain your pilot
11 license?
12 A. I believe it was '98 or '99.
13 Q. Was that for both airplanes and
14 helicopters or just helicopters?
15 A. Just helicopters.
16 Q. Have you ever flown
17 on your helicopter?
18 A. That is another one of Virginia's
19 lies.
20 Q. The question is have you ever done
21 that?
22 A. I have never flown
23 at any time ever, in any helicopter,
24 in any place, any time, in any state, in any
25 country, at any time anywhere.

2 Q. Have you ever had dinner with
3 at Jeffrey's home, at any
4 of Jeffrey's homes?
5 A. No, I don't believe so.
6 Q. Have you traveled on Jeffrey's
7 planes with ?
8 A. Yes, I have.
9 Q. Would that have been in 2002?
10 A. It's very hard for me to recollect
11 exact dates but that sounds about right.
12 Q. Was that during the time that
13 Virginia was working for Jeffrey?
14 A. I don't know that Virginia ever did
15 work for Jeffrey. I don't exactly know if
16 she testified to her so-called duties, we
17 know she is a serial liar so I can't testify
18 to what she did or didn't do. So I object to
19 that characterization of her. So repeat the
20 question, please.
21 Q. Can you read the question back?
22 (Record read.)
23 Q. You can answer the question.
24 A. What was the question again?
25 Q. When you were traveling on the
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 106 of 465

2 plane with , was that during
3 the time, it was 2002, that you were on a
4 flight with was that during the time
5 Virginia was working for Jeffrey?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form.
7 Misstates the witness' answer and if you
8 can answer the question, you can answer
9 it.
10 A. Well, like I said, I don't recall
11 exactly when I flew with him. I don't recall
12 when Virginia, we know what Virginia claims
13 when she left, so I can't answer the
14 question. I have no idea.
15 Q. Do you know ?
16 A. I do.
17 Q. How long have you known him?
18 A. A very long time.
19 Q. Since you were a child?
20 A. I really -- it's so long, it's
21 really a long time ago. I just don't recall.
22 Q. Do you remember how you first met
23 him?
24 A. No, I do not.
25 Q. Did you introduce him to Jeffrey?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 107 of 465
Page 107
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. That would be another of Virginia's
3 lies and the lies you perpetrate. I never
4 introduced to Jeffrey Epstein
5 at any time ever, so just add that the to
6 long list of lies.
7 Q. Did Jeffrey know ?
8 A. Clearly he knew him. I think we
9 have that answer but how -- yeah.
10 Q. Do you know how Jeffery met
11
12 A. I do not know Jeffrey met
13 What I do know is that I did not
14 introduce them. That is one of the many
15 lies. Are we tallying all the lies?
16 Q. Do you know when Jeffrey met
17
18 A. I do not know when Jeffrey met
19 .
20 Q. Did you ever introduce
21 to any girls under the age of 18 who
22 were not friends of yours children?
23 A. I have not introduced
24 to anyone that I am aware of other than
25 friends of mine who have kids under that age
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 108 of 465

1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 that he may have met socially through me.
3 Q. Did you ever introduce
4 to Virginia in London?
5 A. I understand her story about
6 but again, her tissue of lies is extremely
7 hard to pick apart what is true and what
8 isn't. Actually I wouldn't recollect her at
9 all but for her tissue stories about this
10 situation.
11 Q. So did you ever introduce
12 to Virginia in London?
13 A. I have no recollection.
14 Q. Did Virginia ever stay at your home
15 in London, your town home?
16 A. I know she claims she did but if
17 you are asking me here today to remember
18 specifically, I cannot.
19 Q. Do you remember taking a trip with
20 Virginia to travel over to Europe, including
21 London?
22 A. So I have seen her reports and I
23 have seen the plane reports. I see she says
24 she was on that but again, I really have no
25 recollection of her.

3 time of that trip?

8 of that trip?

11 A. I didn't even know she was on the

13 Q. Did you hold her passport for her
14 when she was traveling?
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
16 form and foundation.

18 of her even being on the trip nor holding her

13 MS. McCAWLEY: It has.
14 MS. MENNINGER: Is it the same
15 exact photograph.
16 MS. McCAWLEY: I believe so. We
17 will find one. The picture has been
18 produced a number of times.
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: I've seen different
20 iterations of this, I don't believe I
21 have ever seen this.
22 MS. McCAWLEY: We had them blow it
23 up on a page so she could see it. We
24 could use an article.

2 will skip ahead. Hold that until we can
3 find one that has the Bates range on it.
4 Q. Do you recall Virginia being at
5 your London town home?
6 A. I do not.
7 Q. Do you recall going to dinner with
8 , Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia
9 Roberts in London, at any time?
10 A. I do not.

12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Do you remember him visiting you
14 and Jeffrey in New York in the spring of
15 2001?
16 A. Again, I can't testify to any
17 specific dates.
18 Q. So you don't have a recollection of
19 that?
20 A. I have a recollection -- you've
21 asked me if I have a recollection of being in
22 New York but if you are asking for a date, I
23 cannot confirm that date.

12 picture?
13 A. I just testified I don't know who
14 took the picture.
15 Q. So you don't know if Jeffery
16 Epstein took the picture?
17 A. When I tell you I don't know who
18 took the picture, it doesn't mean him -- I
19 don't know who took the picture. You can
20 come up with 50 names, I still do not know

12 form and foundation.
13 A. There were no girls on the island
14 at all. No girls, no women, other than the

17 was nobody female outside of the cooks and
18 the cleaners.
19 Q. Did you, as part of your duties in

2 asked Virginia Roberts or whatever she is
3 called now to have sex with anybody.
4 Q. Did you ever provide Virginia
5 Roberts with an outfit, an outfit of a sexual
6 nature to wear for ?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

9 A. I think we addressed the outfit
10 issue.
11 Q. I am asking you if you ever
12 provided her with an outfit of a sexual
13 nature to wear for ?

18 moment.
19 (Maxwell Exhibit 6, flight logs,
20 marked for identification.)
21 A. Do you mind if I take a break for
22 the bathroom.

2 We are off the record.
3 (Recess.)
4 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: It's now 11:26,
5 we are back on the record and starting
6 disk No. 3.
7 Q. Ms. Maxwell, I think I handed you
8 right before the break, did I hand you the
9 flight logs, they look like this. Did I mark
10 those yet, I thought I did.
11 A. I don't believe I have it.
12 Q. These admittedly are a little
13 difficult to read so what I'm going to
14 provide you with to assist is I have a chart
15 that has the airport codes, because it will
16 have, for example, just for the record
17 reflects that the first page of document
18 , it will have a code in the from line
19 that says PBI, for example, to TEB so I a
20 chart that matches up, just in case you don't
21 understand what those letters mean, PBI
22 meaning Palm Beach, TEB meaning Teterboro,
23 which is New Jersey, but others are more
24 difficult but just for you to be able to
25 understand the logs, I will provide you with
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 119 of 465
Page 119

2 that.
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: So we are clear, if
4 the witness has personal knowledge of
5 what these are that's fine but I don't
6 know what these are and I don't expect
7 the witness to accept the representation
8 that they are what they are.
9 MS. McCAWLEY: If she can testify
10 to what city it is, she can state that
11 on the record.
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: If she knows what it
13 is, she knows what it is, we are not
14 putting any affirmatively on the record
15 until you ask your questions.
16 Q. So I'm going to ask you and I think
17 we flagged a few of the pages which may
18 direct us a little bit easier but I will do
19 it by Bates number which is at the bottom of
20 the document kind of at the side.
21 The first I will direct your
22 attention to is
23 A. Does it have a tab?
24 Q. It should. Let me make sure.
25 A. Yes it does.

2 Q. So I'm directing your attention to
3 the bottom, two lines up from the bottom,
4 there is a flight --
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Are you on
6 MS. McCAWLEY:
7 Q. So this flight is from, the one I'm
8 looking at, I think it's highlighted on your
9 copy. On the far corner on the date, it says
10 at the top and this would be the
11 and then the are the two I'm going to
12 direct your attention to.
13 Q. On that first one on the you
14 will see the column reading PBI in the from
15 column to TEB in the to column and you will
16 see some initials, you will see JE for
17 Jeffrey Epstein, GM for Ghislaine Maxwell,
18 for and then Virginia?
19 A. I have to object.
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: You don't get to
21 object.
22 Q. She is turning into a lawyer
23 already?
24 A. I would like to.
25 Q. Let me ask the question and if you
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 121 of 465
Page 121
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 have an issue -- so with respect to this

9 on a flight with and Jeffrey
10 Epstein at any time?
11 A. I don't.
12 Q. How often did you fly on a plane

14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form

17 about, other than friends of mine that had
18 kids.
19 Q. Did you regularly fly on Jeffrey's
20 plane with individuals who were under the age
21 of 18?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

25 Q. Did you regularly fly on Jeffrey
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 122 of 465
Page 122
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Epstein's planes with individuals who were
3 under the age of 18?
4 A. I regularly flew on Jeffrey
5 Epstein's airplane but I cannot testify as to
6 flying with people under the age. I don't
7 believe that I did.
8 Q. Why wouldn't you remember flying
9 with a 17 year old?
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
11 form and foundation.
12 A. How would I know, one, that she is
13 17, how would you know that, how do you know
14 I'm on the plane.
15 Q. Are you saying you are not on this
16 flight, so this is a Palm Beach to Teterboro.
17 This says the JE, GM and Virginia. The GM
18 you are saying is not you?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: I object to the
20 form. You can answer the question if
21 you know.
22 A. How do you know the GM is me.
23 Q. Is it your testimony that on the
24 flight logs when it represents GM that it is
25 not you flying on the plane?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 123 of 465
Page 123
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
3 form and foundation.
4 A. GM can stand for any level, it
5 could be Georgina, George.
6 Q. Are there any people that flew with
7 Jeffrey Epstein that had the initials GM?
8 A. I don't know.
9 Q. Do you recall flying with Jeffrey
10 Epstein on his plane over 300 times during
11 the period of 1999 to 2005?
12 A. I cannot testify to how many times
13 I was on his plane because that would just be
14 impossible.
15 Q. You were on his plane regularly,
16 would you say?
17 A. I already testified I was on his
18 plane regularly.
19 Q. Is it your testimony and I'm
20 referring now to the line that we were just
21 talking about that you were not on the flight
22 from Palm Beach to Teterboro that lists JE,
23 GM, and Virginia?
24 A. I am not testifying to that. I am
25 just saying that you cannot be sure that is
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 124 of 465
Page 124
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 me.
3 Q. So as you sit here today, you don't
4 believe you flew on that plane?
5 A. I'm not saying that. I'm just
6 saying you cannot be sure that's me.
7 Q. Do you have reason to doubt that
8 when it says GM on these flight logs that
9 that represents you?
10 A. I cannot testify to that. I'm just
11 saying it may not be me.
12 Q. In looking at the flight logs and
13 look up, let's move up a couple of lines. If
14 you start at the top, you are going to see
15 JE, , then JE, ,
16 JE, , JE, GM, JE, GM, JE, GM,
17 , reposition, JE, GM, JE, GM
18 , JE, GM, ,
19 female,
20 repositioning. JE, GM, , JE,
21 GM, , JE, GM, Virginia,
22 JE, GM, Virginia, repositioning and then
23 a certification.
24 So is it your testimony in looking
25 at that that you do not believe that the GM
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 125 of 465
Page 125
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 represents you?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
4 form and foundation.
5 A. I'm not saying that. I'm just
6 saying that you cannot -- I can't sit here
7 and tell you for sure GM is me and I cannot
8 testify remembering being on a flight at that
9 time.
10 Q. You don't remember being on any of
11 these flights with the initial GM?
12 A. I remember being on many flights.
13 I cannot testify that is a flight I am on.
14 Q. Let's go to the next page which is
15 going to be I want you to look at
16 line -- so the date is at the top, so it's
17 and if you go down, you will see
18 a line that says the and if you scroll
19 over you will see PBI to TIST, if you look at
20 the airport codes, TIST is going to be
21 representative for the U.S. Virgin Islands
22 and then you will see the list on the plane
23 JE, GM, and Virginia Roberts.
24 Do you recall flying from Palm
25 Beach to the U.S. Virgin Islands with
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 126 of 465
Page 126
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Jeffrey, yourself, and Virginia
3 Roberts?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: I object to the form
5 and just so the record is clear, we
6 don't agree with whatever your
7 characterizations are. The document
8 speaks for itself and she can answer
9 based on whatever her personal knowledge
10 is.
11 MS. McCAWLEY: I understand.
12 Q. Do you recall flying with those
13 individuals from Palm Beach to the U.S.
14 Virgin Islands?
15 A. I have no recollection of any
16 individual flight you are pointing out here.
17 You are talking about 2001, how many years
18 ago is that?
19 Q. I'm asking the questions.
20 A. I'm not being difficult. I'm just
21 asking, it's like 14, 15 years ago, it's
22 impossible, I'm sorry.
23 Q. So your testimony is you don't
24 recall flying on that flight with Virginia
25 Roberts?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 127 of 465
Page 127
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. I cannot testify to that flight.
3 Q. Let's look at the next flight which
4 is on the from the Virgin Islands back
5 to Palm Beach, JE, Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine
6 Maxwell, , Virginia Roberts, the
7 same individuals on the above flight.
8 A. It doesn't say my name, it has some
9 initials.
10 Q. I understand, the initials GM.
11 Do you recall flying on a plane, on
12 one of Jeffrey's planes from the Virgin
13 Islands to Palm Beach with Virginia Roberts?
14 A. I do not.
15 Q. Was there any other person that
16 flew with Jeffrey Epstein with frequency
17 during that time period in these logs that
18 have the initials GM?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
20 form and foundation.
21 A. I would have to look at all the
22 flight logs, I have no idea, I flew
23 frequently.
24 Q. Why don't you take a look at the
25 next three pages and see if that refreshes
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 128 of 465
Page 128
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 your recollection.
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: You are talking
4 about
5 MS. McCAWLEY: She can pick any
6 couple of pages, those have a lot of the
7 individuals on them so that is a good
8 sampling.
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: So pick any pages
10 you want.
11 Q. Does that refresh your recollection
12 at all as to whether GM represents you or
13 some other individual?
14 A. Again, I can't testify whether that
15 represents me or not, I don't see any other
16 GMs but you have to understand that even if
17 my name is on that record doesn't mean I was
18 on the flight.
19 Q. So are you contesting the accuracy
20 of the flight logs? In other words, you said
21 it doesn't represent you are on the flight so
22 is it your testimony just because a name is
23 listed doesn't mean they were actually on the
24 flight?

2 form and foundation.
3 A. I can't testify to what -- these
4 are records that were produced by
5 is on here, so these aren't federally
6 mandated records, so I can't testify to what
7 he produced.
8 Q. I would like you to turn to page,
9 at the bottom, the Bates number is .
10 And the month is .
11 A. Okay.
12 Q. If you go down to the number that
13 is that would be you're
14 going to see on that line an which is a
15 and then you
16 will see which is going to be, I'm going
17 to pronounce it incorrectly,
18 I'm sure I'm not pronouncing that
19 correctly. Then you will see in the list,
20 you will see JE, GM, ,
21 , it looks like --
22 A. I believe it says male.
23 Q. Yes. Then I
24 believe. Is that GM on this page
25 representative of you?

2 A. Well, this would be a flight that I
3 would potentially remember with
4 on it but I don't actually recall going to
5 Russia.
6 Q. Are those your initials, do you
7 recall being on the flight?
8 A. Those are my initials with
9 , I don't recall this flight
10 either, but I would be more likely to if I
11 had a bit more time to study the timing of
12 this.
13 Q. Your testimony is you don't recall
14 flying with from to
15
16 A. I don't recall the to
17 flight. I have definitely flown with
18 .
19 Q. On that same page you will see
20 beneath there, beneath 22 you will see the
21 indication, same as above, same as above,
22 same as above in the column that originally
23 had the initials.
24 A. Uh-huh.
25 Q. And the names.

1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. Uh-huh.
3 Q. Do you recall flying with
4 from to
5
6 A. I do.
7 Q. So the GM that would be represented
8 in that column would be you?
9 A. I recall going to with
10 so that is likely to be me.
11 Q. You were on Jeffrey's plane for
12 that trip?
13 A. I believe I was.
14 Q. Do you know who
15 is?
16 A. I do not.
17 Q. I'm going back towards the front
18 which is going to be please. And
19 you're going to see --
20 A. Hang on I'm not --
21 Q. Take your time.
22 A. Okay.
23 Q. You are going to see in the date
24 column, you will see and then about
25 halfway down you will see

2 then you will see the which
3 is the column which is where I want you to
4 start looking at the log and there you're
5 going to see

11 A. Okay.
12 Q. If you look at the column, if you
13 go back up to the top on the if you look
14 at the column you will see JE, GM,
15 Virginia Roberts and I believe it says
16 sorry I'm not reading that very
17 well.
18 Do you recall flying from, if you
19 see the dates, the
20 Do you recall a trip that went from
21 the United States to and to the places
22 I just mentioned where Virginia Roberts was
23 on the plane with you?

2 A. I already testified that I don't
3 recall Virginia on any of these flights.
4 Q. I would like to mark, as Maxwell 7,

6 (Maxwell Exhibit 7, photo, marked
7 for identification.)
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Has this document
9 been produced in discovery?
10 MS. McCAWLEY: Yes.
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Do you have a Bates
12 number?
13 MS. McCAWLEY: This one doesn't.
14 Q. I'm going to ask you --
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't recall
16 seeing this document so I would like to
17 see a Bates number document before we
18 ask questions about it.
19 MS. McCAWLEY: Can you go look for
20 it and I will continue. We will set
21 that aside until we get a Bates number.
22 You may want to leave that log up and
23 set it to the side and we will bounce
24 back to that.
25 Q. Do you recall -- I think earlier

Page 134
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 you said you visited Jeffrey's island, I
3 think they called it St. Jeffrey or St.
4 James, the U.S. Virgin Island home.
5 A. St. James.
6 Q. Do you recall whether
7 was ever on that island?
8 A. Categorically, definitively,
9 absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, when
10 I was present or any other time that I am
11 aware of, was ever on that
12 island, I do not believe he went to that
13 island ever ever, that is an absolute
14 fabrication and an absolute flat out lie.
15 Q. Was
 ever at any of Jeffrey
17 Epstein's homes when you present, other than
18 the island I know you said that did not
19 happen, the home in either New York or Palm
20 Beach or New Mexico?
21 A. I do not believe at any time
22 was at any of Jeffrey's
23 homes, I have absolutely no knowledge or
24 otherwise that he was ever there.
25 Q. You don't recall having dinner with

2 him at any of those homes?
3 A. Again, Virginia is absolutely
4 totally lying. This is a subject of
5 defamation about Virginia and the lies she
6 has told and one of lies she told was that
7 President Clinton was on the island where I
8 was present. Absolutely 1000 percent that is
9 a flat out total fabrication and lie.
10 Q. You did fly on planes, Jeffrey
11 Epstein's planes with President Clinton, is
12 that correct?
13 A. I have flown, yes.
14 Q. Would it be fair to say that
15 President Clinton and Jeffrey are friends?
16 A. I wouldn't be able to characterize
17 it like that, no.
18 Q. Are they acquaintances?
19 A. I wouldn't categorize it.
20 Q. He just allowed him to use his
21 plane?
22 A. I couldn't categorize Jeffrey's
23 relationship.
24 Q. When you were on the plane with
25 Jeffrey and President Clinton, did you

2 observe Jeffrey and
3 talking?
4 A. I'm sure they did.
5 Q. Did they seem friendly?
6 A. I don't recollect.
7 Q. Was Epstein one of the original
8 people that conceived the

12 Q. Do you know?
13 A. I don't have -- I don't know what
14 you are talking about.
15 Q. You don't know what I'm talking
16 about.
17 Did you ever, not at one of houses,
18 but did you ever eat dinner with
19 and Jeffrey Epstein?
20 A. Are you just talking in general
21 anywhere.
22 Q. In general?
23 A. I believe on a plane of this nature
24 we would have had a meal.
25 Q. But not outside of the travel on
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 137 of 465
Page 137

2 the flights?
3 A. I can't recollect having a meal
4 with them, but just so we are clear, the
5 allegations that had a meal on
6 Jeffrey's island is 100 percent false.
7 Q. But he may have had a meal on
8 Jeffrey's plane?
9 A. I'm sure he had a meal on Jeffrey's
10 plane.
11 Q. You do know how many times he flew
12 on Jeffrey's plane?
13 A. I don't.
14 Q. Do you know who is?
15 A. I do.
16 Q. How do you know him?
17 A. He used to work or still works for
18
19 Q. Did you ever have a relationship
20 with him?
21 A. We are talking about adult
22 consensual relationships, it's off the
23 record.
24 Q. I'm not asking what you did with
25 him, I'm asking if you ever had a
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 138 of 465
Page 138
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 relationship with him?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: If you understand
4 the term relationship, certainly you can
5 answer that.
6 A. Define relationship.
7 Q. Somebody that you would have spent
8 time together, either seeing them in a
9 romantic relationship or --
10 A. You need to be, what do you mean by
11 romantic. I was friends with but you
12 are suggesting something more so I want to be
13 clear what you are actually asking me.
14 Q. You defined it. You said you were
15 friends with him. If that's what you were
16 that's all I need to know.
17 While you were on the trip with
18 , do you recall where you
19 stayed at these locations, in other words,
20 would you leave the jet and stay overnight at
21 a hotel, do you have a recollection of this
22 trip?
23 A. I recollect the trip but if you're
24 asking me where we stayed, you can see it's a
25 very fast paced trip. It was very tiring and
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 139 of 465
Page 139
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 I don't recollect where we stayed.
3 Q. Do you recollect if you stayed at
4 the same place stayed? In
5 other words, if you left the plane to go a
6 hotel did you all go together is your
7 recollection?
8 A. I honestly don't recollect, no.
9 Q. Part of this trip we were just
10 talking about, there is a flight that goes to
11 Thailand, do you remember being in Thailand?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation.
14 A. Are you asking me --
15 Q. On the trip.
16 A. Are you referencing something?
17 Q. The part that, let me make sure
18 I've got it here. The entry that would be
19 the Thailand, would be the one -- let me make
20 sure I'm correct. I have you on the wrong
21 page, it's actually the page before. It's
22 going to be And it's going to be the
23 entry on starting on and then
24 it goes down to where it has the same as
25 above, to -- I'm saying

2
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: That's what the
4 document says.
5 Q. I'm not representing the date but
6 there it is. So the last leg of that where
7 it says same as above has, the second to
8 last, I'm sorry on the
10 Do you remember being in Thailand
11 with ?
12 A. I do.
13 Q. Do you remember what the purpose of
14 that trip was?
15 A. I don't.
16 Q. Do you know whether -- do you
17 recall, did you stay the night in Thailand?
18 A. I don't recall.
19 Q. Do you recall why you went to
20 Thailand?
21 A. I don't recall.
22 Q. Who is ?
23 A. She I believe was a stewardess on
24 this flight.
25 Q. Did she perform any massages on the

2 flight?
3 A. I don't recollect any massages on
4 the flight.
5 Q. Do you know who is?
6 A. It doesn't -- no I don't know who
7 that is, I can't recall.
8 Q. This is not in color, it's a black
9 and white but it has the Bates label on it.
10 Should I take the sticker off the one that
11 has -- I don't know if you want to swap it.
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Let the record
13 reflect I am replacing this on the black
14 and white copy of this exhibit with
15 .
16 Q. So, we were talking earlier, we
17 were looking at the flight logs and we were
18 talking about a trip and let me just get you
19 back to the page.

2 Q. Can I direct your attention to the
3 picture, please.
4 A. Of course.
5 Q. Can you tell me who is in this
6 picture, who is pictured here, and for the
7 court reporter's benefit, can you go from the
8 left of the picture to the right of the
9 picture, to the extent you can identify the
10 individuals?
11 A. Sure. I cannot identify the person
12 on the left, I cannot identify the person
13 next left. I can identify Jeffrey Epstein.
14 I cannot identify the next person to his
15 right and the next person in the picture is
16 myself.
17 Q. Is the individual all the way to
18 the left at the beginning of the picture,
19 does that resemble . You might
20 want to look at the color version if that
21 helps you at all, I know it's not the marked
22 one. I don't if that's easier to see, they
23 are both dark.
24 A. That does not look like
25 at all.

2 Q. Do you recall --
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Let's mark this then
4 as deposition Exhibit 8 since we are
5 referring to it and then you can give us
6 copies as well.
7 MS. MENNINGER: It's different
8 because it has other people in this
9 color photo.
10 (Maxwell Exhibit 8, photo, marked
11 for identification.)
12 Q. Do you recall who took this
13 photograph?
14 A. I do not.
15 Q. Do you recall this photograph being
16 taken by Virginia?
17 A. First of all, I don't know where we
18 are.
19 Q. So you don't recognize the
20 building?
21 A. I don't recognize the building and
22 I don't recognize -- the only two people I
23 recognize in the picture are Jeffrey and
24 myself.
25 Q. Does this like look a picture of a
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 144 of 465

2 building that you would have seen when you
3 were on the trip in Europe?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
5 form and foundation.
6 A. I can't possibly answer that.
7 Q. Do you recall Virginia ever taking
8 pictures?
9 A. I barely recall Virginia, period.
10 Q. Do you recall her ever taking
11 pictures?
12 A. No, I don't.
13 Q. I'm going to direct your attention,
14 still within the flight logs to -- starting
15 on the next page from where you just were
16 which is going to be And the date at
17 the top says you will see and I'm
18 directing your attention down towards the
19 middle to the bottom where you will see the
20 numbers
21 A. Uh-huh.
22 Q. And we've got actually I'm going to
23 direct your attention to the one that starts
24 with

2 and in the line, the remarks line you will
3 see JE, GM,
?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Are you reading the
6 29th, is that what you're reading?
7 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm reading the
8 29th, yes.
9 Q. Below that you will see JE, GM,
10
11
12 Do you see that?
13 A. I do.
14 Q. Do you recall a trip from Teterboro
15 to Santa Fe and Santa Fe back to Palm Beach
16 with these individuals?
17 A. I don't.
18 Q. Do you recall being on a plane with
19 and Virginia Roberts?
20 A. I don't.
21 Q. Do you recall ever witnessing any
22 sexual interaction on one of Jeffrey's planes
23 with any of these individuals?
24 A. I do not, absolutely not.
25 Q. Did Jeffrey have a fold out bed on
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 146 of 465
Page 146
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 one of his planes?
3 A. There was a bed on one of his
4 planes that folded out, yes.
5 Q. Do you recall whether with respect
6 to this being in Santa Fe, do you recall
7 whether you were there for some form of a
8 party?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
10 form and foundation.
11 A. I don't recall the trip at all and
12 this looks like a total work trip, not a
13 party trip.
14 Q. What would be the difference
15 between a work trip and a party trip?
16 A. Just that I would be on trips for
17 work and I believe that this looks like,
18 looks like it's one of the -- probably one of
19 the designers and the time would meet with a
20 trip to decorate the house, just the timing
21 of it.
22 Q. So would Virginia be brought on
23 trips that were for the purpose of work and
24 decorating the house?
25 A. Like I said, I never worked with
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 147 of 465
Page 147
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 her but you would have to ask Jeffrey what he
3 brought her on the trip for.
4 Q. But she would travel with him when
5 there was a work trip like this?
6 A. I can't -- I'm seeing that she is
7 on this flight but I have no idea what she is
8 doing, he invited her, it would not be my
9 job.
10 Q. What about Nadia Bjorlin, would she
11 regularly travel with Jeffrey on flights?
12 A. I have no idea, you would have to
13 look through the flight logs. I have no
14 idea.
15 Q. Your recollection is -- what is
16 your recollection, do you recollect Nadia
17 traveling often on flights with Jeffrey?
18 A. Absolutely not. No, not at all. I
19 don't recollect her actually on the flight at
20 all.
21 Q. I think you can set that aside for
22 the moment.
23 (Maxwell Exhibit 9, message pad
24 pages, marked for identification.)
25 Q. We will mark as Exhibit 9 these
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 148 of 465
Page 148
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 excerpts from -- we will identify what they
3 are but from the message pads.
4 Did you want to correct anything?
5 A. I want to make an addendum.
6 Would you mind rereading the last
7 question back to me?
8 (Record read.)
9 A. I also just want to say that at
10 this point I cannot recollect flying to
11 parties. Jeffrey went for work so -- was
12 this in Santa Fe, this flight as well.
13 Q. The flight we were looking at, yes
14 but it was to Santa Fe --
15 A. I don't recall going to any parties
16 in Santa Fe at any time but certainly flying
17 to Santa Fe for a party seems highly
18 improbable.
19 Q. So I'm going to direct your
20 attention to the document that I set before
21 you which is Bates number and it
22 has different Bates numbers because it's a
23 smaller version of the larger production.
24 These are the pages I will be asking about.
25 In the time that you were working
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 149 of 465
Page 149
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 with Jeffrey in Palm Beach, do you recall a
3 process for taking, anybody at the house
4 taking messages when incoming phone calls
5 came in?
6 A. You are supposed to take a message
7 and receive the message and write the message
8 down. Who was the message was for, what time
9 it was taken and who took it and what the
10 message was, obviously.
11 Q. Does what's in front of you look
12 familiar with respect to the message pads
13 that you would have used at the house?
14 A. It is familiar.
15 Q. I'm going to direct your attention
16 to the second page of it?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: These all have SAO
18 numbers on them or Bates ranges and I
19 don't see any of your Bates ranges on
20 these. I know you have produced message
21 pads but those have your Bates range
22 numbers on them and I'm wondering if
23 these are different documents.
24 MS. McCAWLEY: It's the same, just
25 ours have the Bates underneath them.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 150 of 465
Page 150
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 These were produced as part of the rule
3 26 discovery. We can get the additional
4 Bates if you want.
5 Q. The one I'm asking about first is
6 the . You can look at that and then
7 I will identify the Bates number referenced
8 in this case.
9 I want to direct your attention to
10 the top right-hand corner just so I have an
11 understanding of how these messages were
12 taken. So I see that it says at the top it
13 says in the for line it says Ms. Maxwell and
14 the date of and then I see under the
15 M line it looks like or
16 something like that, a phone number and a
17 message saying returning your call and on the
18 bottom it looks like
19 Explain to me, is this -- does this
20 represent taking down a message for you
21 from is that how these work?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
23 form and foundation. Go ahead.
24 Q. My question is, I'm trying to
25 understand how the messages were taken.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 151 of 465
Page 151
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Looking at this message pad, where it says
3 signed can you tell me who was?
4 A. I cannot.
5 Q. You do not know.
6 Typically when these messages were
7 taken in your practice when you were there,
8 would the individual who took the message
9 write their name on the message?
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
11 form and foundation.
12 A. I don't recollect, you can ask who
13 wrote it so you can find out who it was.
14 Q. Do you know who is?
15 A. I don't.
16 Q. I'm going to direct your
17 attention -- do we have a Bates number for
18 that?
19 MR. EDWARDS:
20 Q. Giuffre for that one.
21 I will direct your attention to the
22 first page which has the on it.
23 A. Okay.
24 Q. Now at the top of that document, on
25 the right-hand side, the message that reads
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 152 of 465
Page 152
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 for JE, date , message
3 and then it's signed GM.
4 Is that your signature?
5 A. That's not my handwriting.
6 Q. Would other people take a message,
7 how did this process work, is there someone
8 else in the house with the initials GM?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
10 form and foundation.
11 A. I cannot answer that. It's not my
12 handwriting.
13 Q. I'm trying to understand how this
14 gets there. If you took a message and didn't
15 write it down, would someone else record that
16 message for you?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
18 form and foundation.
19 A. All I can tell you, this is not my
20 handwriting so I cannot -- I have no idea
21 what that is.
22 Q. Was the practice that, what was the
23 practice when someone answered the phone with
24 these message pads, what were they supposed
25 to do?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 153 of 465
Page 153
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. They were supposed to take a
3 message and the time and date and give the
4 message.
5 Q. Were they supposed to indicate who
6 took the message?
7 A. They were but it wasn't -- I don't
8 really recall the actual process. I can see
9 from here it looks like you were supposed to
10 but that's not my handwriting so I can't say
11 what that was.
12 Q. Do you know who is?
13 A. No, I don't.
14 Q. Do you know whether
15 was under the age of 18?
16 A. I just testified I couldn't
17 remember who she was so it would be difficult
18 to know how old she was.
19 Q. Do you know if she was coming to
20 the house to provide massages?
21 A. I don't remember who she is at all,
22 so no.
23 Q. And then I would like to direct
24 your attention to the message right
25 underneath it. Which says JE, ,
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 154 of 465
Page 154

2 and has a phone number and the message says,
3 wants to know if she should bring her friend
4 tonight.
5 What is that message referring to?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
7 form and foundation.
8 A. I can't possibly know.
9 Q. Did individuals at the house take
10 messages for underage girls to come over and
11 bring friends for the purpose of providing
12 massages?
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
14 form and foundation.
15 A. How would I possibly know what you
16 are talking about.
17 Q. Did you record messages at the
18 house?
19 A. It's not my job.
20 Q. You did from time to time record
21 messages?
22 A. Hardly ever.
23 Q. But you did from time to time do
24 it?
25 A. I'm just saying I hardly ever took
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 155 of 465
Page 155

2 messages, very, very, very, very
3 infrequently.
4 Q. Do you know if brought her
5 friend over on that night?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
7 form and foundation.
8 A. One, I don't know what this message
9 is, I don't know if I was in Palm Beach, I
10 don't know who is, I don't know who
11 is and I don't know what this message
12 is referring to.
13 Q. So on January 2nd of 2003, were you
14 in Palm Beach?
15 A. I don't know.
16 Q. Where would you have been other
17 than Palm Beach at the time?
18 A. I could have been anywhere.
19 Q. Where did you typically live?
20 A. What are you asking me?
21 Q. So for example, in 2003, where was
22 your primary residence, was it wherever
23 Jeffrey was living and staying or was it
24 independent of that?
25 A. What was the date again.

2 Q. In 2003?
3 A. The end of 2003?
4 Q. January, the beginning.
5 A. I don't know, I could have been
6 anywhere, Jeffrey and I were leading almost
7 separate lives by then.
8 Q. If you were at the house that day,
9 did you recall seeing anybody by the name of
10
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
12 form and foundation.
13 A. I don't know if I was at the house,
14 so I can't testify to that.
15 Q. Let's flip back to the next page,
16 the one we were on before the the
17 message towards the bottom that says, for
18 Jeffrey, message of Ghislaine. And it says,
19 Would it be helpful to have and then redacted
20 come to Palm Beach today to stay here and
21 help train new staff with Ghislaine. Who
22 were you referring to in that message; do you
23 remember?

18 massage or for any other reason to be with

21 and foundation.
22 A. I hardly ever took a message. I
23 have absolutely no way of knowing, maybe one
24 of my friends' daughters called to say they
25 were coming to visit me. I have never taken

2 messages, I don't know about how I would
3 possibly know if somebody I spoke to, one or
4 two times I took a message is, how old they
5 would be but I have never taken a message
6 where I was aware of anything being under the
7 age of 18 and I probably took it so
8 infrequently, it would be impossible.
9 Q. Can you turn to , it
10 should be the next page.
11 A. Uh-huh.
12 Q. Do you see at the top, it says, for
13 Mr. J. 11/8/04 and then the name is
14 redacted. It says, I have a female for him.

16 Jeffrey to say they have a female for him?
17 Do you know?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

5 say, quote, I have a female for him?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
7 form and foundation.
8 A. I can't testify anything about this
9 message, I don't know anything about it.
10 Q. I'm going to direct your attention

12 the bottom left, you are going to see a
13 message for Jeffrey, from , it
14 says she doesn't have a number and left a
15 message that she called.
16 Do you know who is?

2 A. How would I possibly, these were
3 messages taken when I was not at the house
4 and I have no idea who they are nor how old
5 they are nor anything.
6 Q. How do you know you weren't at the
7 house on this day?
8 A. I was hardly at the house in 2005.
9 Q. So you could have been there, you
10 just don't know?
11 A. In the five days I might have been
12 there in 2005, I suppose it's possible but
13 it's unlikely.
14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Do you know why this
15 isn't redacted if you are representing
16 all the names of people who are underage
17 have been redacted from these records.
18 MS. McCAWLEY: I think it was -- my
19 assumption is it was a miss by the
20 police department.
21 Q. I will direct your attention to
22 so you will skip a page and go back,
23 it's the final page in the message pads and
24 you will see on the top left for Jeffrey, on

11 we're starting disk No. 4. We are back
12 on the record.
13 Q. Ms. Maxwell, before the break, we
14 were talking about and I think it's one of
15 the exhibits that's marked in front of you,
16 I'm not sure of the number, but the police
17 report that I showed you earlier today.
18 Now that you have knowledge of the
19 police report and the criminal investigation
20 with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, do you
21 believe that Jeffrey Epstein abused any minor
22 children?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
24 form and foundation.
25 A. Can you repeat the question please
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 169 of 465
Page 169

2 and break it down so it's more
3 understandable.
4 Q. Now that you have the police report
5 that I showed you this morning that you had
6 an opportunity to look at.
7 A. You gave it to me, I did not look
8 at it.
9 Q. The questions that I asked you
10 about the police report -- you are aware
11 there is a police report?
12 A. I am aware there is a police
13 report.
14 Q. You are aware there was a criminal
15 investigation of Jeffrey Epstein?
16 A. I am aware that there was that.
17 Q. Now that you are aware of those two
18 things and having talked to Jeffrey Epstein,
19 do you believe Jeffrey Epstein sexually
20 abused minors?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
22 form and foundation.
23 A. Can you reask the second part of
24 that question please.
25 Q. Sure. The two documents we were
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 170 of 465
Page 170
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 talking about, the document and the
3 investigation, you said you are aware of and
4 after having talked to Jeffrey Epstein, do
5 you believe Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused
6 minors?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
8 form and foundation.
9 A. What do you mean I talked to
10 Jeffrey, you need to break the question down
11 further.
12 Q. So you have the police report.
13 A. I do.
14 Q. And you are aware of the criminal
15 investigation?
16 A. I am.
17 Q. Let's take those two things. After
18 knowing those two things, do you believe that
19 Jeffrey Epstein abused minor children?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. Can you explain what you mean by
23 the question actually.
24 Q. I think the question speaks for
25 itself. I will try again. I will say it one

1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 more time because I want you to be able to
3 understand it.
4 Knowing that you have the police
5 report here and knowing about the criminal
6 investigation, do you believe that Jeffrey
7 Epstein sexually abused minors?
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objection.
9 A. I know what you put in front of me
10 and I know what I read.
11 Q. I'm asking what you believe, do you
12 believe Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused
13 minors?
14 A. I can only tell you what I read and
15 what you showed me.
16 Q. I'm asking what you believe, from
17 your own belief, do you believe that Jeffrey
18 Epstein abused minors?
19 A. I can only go from what I know
20 personally and what I know personally about
21 what Virginia's lies talked about. She is
22 the only person I know that actually claimed
23 that. And I can say with certitude that
24 everything Virginia said was a lie.
25 Q. You are aware Jeffrey Epstein was

2 sentenced for sexual abuse, are you aware of
3 that?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
5 form and foundation.
6 Q. Are you aware that Jeffrey Epstein
7 served time for sexual abuse of a minor?
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
9 form and foundation.
10 A. I don't believe that's what he was
11 sentenced for, actually.
12 Q. So you don't know that Jeffrey
13 Epstein served time for sexually abusing a
14 minor?
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
16 form and foundation.
17 A. I don't believe that's what he was
18 sentenced for.
19 Q. Do you know that Jeffrey Epstein
20 was convicted for procuring a minor for
21 prostitution?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
23 form and foundation.
24 A. I don't know exactly what he was
25 convicted of. I don't know that he was
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 173 of 465
Page 173
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 convicted. I know he spent time in jail.
3 Q. Do you know that he spent time in
4 jail related to an issue with a minor child?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
6 form and foundation.
7 A. I did not know that.
8 Q. What did you think he was spending
9 time in jail for?
10 A. I only know he went to jail for --
11 it was alleged that he hired -- had an
12 underage prostitute.
13 Q. So knowing that, do you believe
14 that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused minors?
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
16 form and foundation.
17 A. I can only tell you what he went to
18 jail for.
19 Q. I'm asking what you believe. I'm
20 not asking what he went to jail for. I'm
21 asking for your belief.
22 A. I cannot testify to what I believe.
23 I can only say what I have seen in the
24 reports and I know he went to jail.
25 Q. You can testify to what you
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 174 of 465
Page 174
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 believe. Do you believe --
3 A. I can only testify --
4 Q. Let me finish the question so the
5 record is clear.
6 Do you believe Jeffrey Epstein
7 sexually abused minors?
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
9 form and foundation.
10 Q. You can answer.
11 A. I can only testify to what I know.
12 I know that Virginia is a liar and I know
13 what she testified is a lie. So I can only
14 testify to what I know to be a falsehood and
15 half those falsehoods are enormous and so I
16 can only categorically deny everything she
17 has said and that is the only thing I can
18 talk about because I have no knowledge of
19 anything else.
20 Q. I'm not asking about Virginia. I'm
21 asking whether you believe that Jeffrey
22 Epstein sexually abused minors?
23 A. Again, I repeat, I can only go on
24 what I know and what I know is a falsehood
25 based on what Virginia said.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 175 of 465
Page 175
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. Do you believe Jeffrey Epstein
3 sexually abused minors?
4 A. Again, I repeat, Virginia is a liar
5 and based on Virginia's stories, that is
6 what -- she lied and I can only then talk
7 about what you've showed me in the police
8 reports and I know he went to jail.
9 Q. Do you believe that Jeffrey Epstein
10 sexually abused minors? I'm asking about
11 your belief.
12 A. Again, I just repeat, I can only
13 go -- my belief is Virginia is a liar.
14 Q. What is that belief?
15 A. She is an absolute liar and
16 everything she said is a lie and therefore,
17 everything that stems from that is a lie.
18 Q. So do you believe that Jeffrey
19 Epstein sexually abused minors?
20 A. Again -- can we move on from here?
21 Q. No. You are going to answer the
22 question.
23 A. I have already.
24 Q. No, you haven't.
25 A. I have.

Page 176
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. Do you believe Jeffrey Epstein
3 sexually abused minors?
4 A. Again, I repeat, the only person I
5 know who has talked about these things that I
6 have personal -- was personally present, was
7 Virginia and I can only talk to Virginia and
8 she is a liar.
9 Q. Setting aside Virginia. Take her
10 out of the picture. It's my question.
11 A. We are here today because of
12 Virginia and her lies because this is a
13 defamation suit.
14 Q. Setting aside Virginia, do you
15 believe Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused
16 minors?
17 A. I cannot set aside Virginia because
18 that's why we are here and this is the only
19 reason I am sitting here in this room and I
20 will not set her aside and I cannot comment
21 about anything else except her because she is
22 the only person I actually know about.
23 Q. Are you refusing to answer that
24 question?
25 A. I am not refusing the question. I
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 177 of 465
Page 177
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 can only testify about Virginia who is an
3 absolute total liar and you all know she is.
4 She lied about her age, you know she lied
5 about absolutely everything. So I can only
6 go on what I know as a liar and she is a
7 liar, an exaggerator, a fantasist and
8 absolutely true terrible person.
9 Q. I want you to listen very
10 carefully. I am asking you to set aside
11 Virginia.
12 A. I can't set aside Virginia.
13 Q. I am asking you to do that for
14 purposes of this question.
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: She doesn't have to.
16 MS. McCAWLEY: She can refuse to
17 answer the question.
18 A. I'm not refusing to answer the
19 question.
20 Q. You are refusing.
21 My question has nothing to do with
22 Virginia. Let me make the record here. My
23 question has nothing to do with Virginia. I
24 want it to be clear for the court. My
25 question has nothing to do with Virginia.

2 What I'm asking you is whether you
3 believe Jeffrey Epstein abused minors?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: I object to the form
5 and you made your record, she answered
6 the question. A fair reading of her
7 answer is she doesn't have a belief
8 because she doesn't have any personal
9 knowledge.
10 MS. McCAWLEY: Now you are
11 testifying for the witness. Let her
12 answer the question.
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: It's a fair answer
14 to the question.
15 A. Again, I testified my only personal
16 knowledge concerns Virginia and everything
17 Virginia has said is an absolute lie, which
18 is why we are here in this room. If you are
19 asking me to testify about things I have no
20 knowledge of other than the police report
21 that you showed me, I am not in a position to
22 make a statement based on that because you
23 are asking me to speculate and I cannot
24 speculate.
25 Q. I'm asking you about your belief.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 179 of 465

2 I'm not asking you to speculate at all. I'm
3 asking what you believe.
4 A. You are asking me to speculate and
5 I won't speculate.
6 Q. I'm not asking you to speculate.
7 I'm asking what you believe.
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: She answered the
9 question and we can move on.
10 MS. McCAWLEY: She hasn't answered
11 the question.
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: We are not going to
13 engage in this debate. She answered the
14 question. If you want to mark it and
15 move to compel an answer to the
16 question, have at it. Okay.
17 Q. Ms. Maxwell, is it your belief that
18 Jeffrey Epstein interacted sexually with
19 minors?
20 A. Again, you are asking me the same
21 type of question exactly but with different
22 language. Again, my only knowledge of
23 somebody who claims these things that I have
24 personal knowledge of is Virginia. Virginia
25 is an absolute liar and everything she has
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 180 of 465
Page 180
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 said is a lie. Therefore, based on those
3 lies I cannot speculate on what anybody else
4 did or didn't do because if Virginia is the
5 example of what that story is and everything
6 she said is false, so everything that leads
7 from that is false.
8 Q. So the 30 other minor children in
9 the police report are also telling lies about
10 being sexually abused during massages with
11 Mr. Epstein?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation. Counsel, can you
14 show me in these police reports who the
15 30 minors are?
16 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm asking my
17 question.
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: You are making a
19 representation about numbers, you are
20 making a representation on the record
21 about what people said or didn't say.
22 We have no knowledge about that. These
23 are all redacted records so these are
24 bad questions. They don't lead to any
25 admissible evidence. It is only being
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 181 of 465
Page 181
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 propounded to the witness to harass her.
3 So we are done with these questions.
4 MS. McCAWLEY: Are you done?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.
6 Q. My question is, are you aware that
7 Jeffrey Epstein was convicted of having
8 relations with a minor child?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: She answered that
10 question already.
11 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm getting to my
12 next question.
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Ask your next
14 question. Don't keep asking the same
15 question.
16 MS. McCAWLEY: You are now
17 shouting, I want the record to reflect
18 that you are interrupting the
19 deposition. I ask you to calm down,
20 take a deep breath and please let me ask
21 my questions.
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your behavior is
23 inappropriate.
24 Q. I will ask you again.
25 Do you believe that Jeffrey Epstein
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 182 of 465
Page 182
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 interacted sexually with minors?
3 A. Again, I go back to this, my only
4 actual knowledge is with Virginia and
5 Virginia is a liar, so I can only talk to
6 what Virginia's story and as I said before
7 and there are so many examples, I mean
8 thousands of examples of her lies, that that
9 is the only thing I can talk to.
10 Q. Based on that you do not believe
11 that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused minors?
12 A. Again, as I said, I'm only talking
13 to what I know, I can only talk to Virginia.
14 Q. So is it your belief that Jeffrey
15 Epstein did not sexually abuse minors?
16 A. Again, I can only talk to what I
17 know and I know that Virginia is a liar and
18 that what she said is a lie. So I can only
19 testify to what she accused and you guys put
20 in the press for salacious purposes and
21 whatever terrible, inappropriate, unethical
22 and terrible reasons you chose to do that
23 about me and I can testify those are all
24 lies.
25 Q. Do you know whether Jeffrey Epstein
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 183 of 465
Page 183
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 sexually abused any minor children?
3 A. Again, I only know 1000 percent
4 that Virginia is a liar. I can only talk to
5 Virginia, her lies and your inappropriate,
6 unethical, really unattractive, terrible use
7 of her and the way that you have abused the
8 system, used the press for purposes that are
9 unethical, inappropriate and appalling.
10 Q. Do you believe that Jeffrey Epstein
11 used massages to lure minors to have sex with
12 him?
13 A. Again, that is Virginia's
14 testimony, which is a lie.
15 Q. But do you believe that?
16 A. Again, I refer back to Virginia.
17 Q. I'm asking whether you believe it
18 or not?
19 A. I can only go with what I know and
20 I know Virginia is a liar and therefore
21 that's a lie.
22 Q. So you don't believe that?
23 A. I said, I only know that Virginia
24 is lying.
25 Q. Are you aware that Jeffrey Epstein
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 184 of 465
Page 184
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 is a registered sex offender?
3 A. I am.
4 Q. Are you aware that Jeffrey Epstein
5 paid considerable amounts of money to settle
6 lawsuits with the minor children that he had
7 sexual contact with?
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
9 form and foundation.
10 A. I have no knowledge of those
11 issues.
12 Q. Why did you continue to maintain
13 contact with Jeffrey Epstein after he pled
14 guilty?
15 A. I'm a very loyal person and Jeffrey
16 was very good to me when my father passed
17 away and I believe that you need to be a good
18 friend in people's hour of need and I felt
19 that it was a very thoughtful, nice thing for
20 me to do to help in very limited fashion
21 which was helping if he had any issue with
22 his homes, in terms of the staffing issues.
23 It was very, very minor but I felt it was
24 thoughtful in somebody's hour of need.
25 Q. Did he continue to pay you during
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 185 of 465
Page 185
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 that time period?
3 A. I was paid a little.
4 Q. You were paid?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. When you say a little, what you did
7 mean by that?
8 A. I don't recall exactly the amount.
9 Q. So in 2009 when you left him, what
10 were you being paid?
11 A. I just told you, I don't recall.
12 Q. Were you being paid $100,000?
13 A. I just don't you I don't recall.
14 Q. Were you paid over a million
15 dollars?
16 A. I think I would remember over a
17 million dollars.
18 Q. So it was under a million dollars?
19 A. It was under a million dollars.
20 Q. Was it over $500,000?
21 A. I just told you, it was under 500,
22 it was an amount of money less than $500,000,
23 less than a million dollars and I did it out
24 of thoughtfulness and consideration for
25 somebody who was in trouble.

2 Q. Did you have an attorney to consult
3 with during the criminal investigation of
4 Jeffrey Epstein?
5 A. I don't believe I did.
6 Q. When did you learn that a search
7 warrant was executed for the Palm Beach
8 house?
9 A. I don't recall exactly.
10 Q. Were you present at the house in
11 advance of the search warrant being executed?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
13 of the question.
14 A. I don't remember when the search
15 warrant was executed and I don't remember the
16 year that the search warrant was executed and
17 whenever that was, I already testified, I was
18 very, very infrequently at the house. So
19 highly unlikely but I was there a couple of
20 days, I just don't know which days it was in
21 relation to the police situation.
22 Q. Did you have a computer at the Palm
23 Beach home that was a computer that you would
24 use?
25 A. No.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 187 of 465
Page 187
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. Was there a computer available for
3 use in the Palm Beach house?
4 A. Can you be more specific.
5 Q. Was there anywhere in the Palm
6 Beach house where there was a computer where
7 you said you worked for him and there were
8 other staff in the house, was there ever a
9 computer in the Palm Beach mansion that was
10 accessible by you or other staff?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
12 form and foundation.
13 A. I stopped being regularly at the
14 house sometime in 2003 so from 2003 to when
15 the police search was executed, I have no
16 memory of what there was or what there was
17 not. I can only testify for what was there
18 when I was present largely.
19 Q. So in 2003 when you were still
20 there, was there a computer that was
21 accessible to you or other staff at the
22 house?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
24 form and foundation.
25 A. There was a desktop computer that
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 188 of 465
Page 188
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 people could use -- just like you would use
3 if you needed to go online to get something,
4 that people could use.
5 Q. Was that on a desk that you would
6 use in your work capacity when you were at
7 the house?
8 A. It was a desk, it was a room I was,
9 I didn't really use that computer.
10 Q. Were there images of naked girls
11 whether they be under the age of 18 or over
12 the age of 18 on that computer?
13 A. I have no recollection of any naked
14 people on that computer when I was there in
15 2003, we are talking.
16 Q. What about from say '99 to 2003?
17 A. No, I can't recollect any naked
18 pictures.
19 Q. Why were the computers removed from
20 the house before the search warrant was
21 executed?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
23 form and foundation.
24 A. I have no knowledge of anything
25 like that.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 189 of 465
Page 189
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. Do you know where the computers are
3 now?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
5 form and foundation.
6 A. I don't know what computers you are
7 talking of and I have no idea what you are
8 referencing.
9 Q. In 2003 you said there was a
10 computer in a room on a desk?
11 A. Right.
12 Q. Do you know where that computer is
13 now?
14 A. I do not.
15 Q. Did you take pictures of nude
16 females in any of Epstein's homes or in and
17 around the homes, out by the pool or anywhere
18 like, in the Palm Beach home, the New York
19 home, USVI home or the New Mexico home?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. Can you repeat the question.
23 Q. Did you take pictures of nude woman
24 over 18 or under 18, females, in any of
25 Jeffrey Epstein's homes, inside or outside in
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 190 of 465
Page 190
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 or around the home?
3 A. I think we need to distinguish
4 between anyone under the age of 18 and over
5 the age of 18.
6 Q. We will start with, did you take
7 pictures of nude females in or around any of
8 Jeffrey's homes of women or females that were
9 under the age of 18?
10 A. No.
11 Q. Did you take pictures of nude
12 females --
13 A. Nude you mean with no clothing on.
14 Q. Or half nude, with no top on, any
15 sort of nakedness to an individual.
16 In any of Jeffrey's homes, either
17 Palm Beach, New Mexico, USVI or New York
18 either outside by the pool, anywhere in or
19 around those homes of females over the age of
20 18?
21 A. So it is possible that I took
22 pictures of people that were somehow semi or
23 had some clothing on or no clothes on but at
24 no time were any of these pictures remotely
25 inappropriate. They were, you could see them
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 191 of 465
Page 191
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 in a mainstream magazine today, there would
3 be no inappropriateness, they would be
4 covered, concealed, you wouldn't see anything
5 at all.
6 The types of -- first, I took very
7 few and they were always by request, this was
8 a picture you could put on your -- gift to
9 your parent or to your grandparents to put on
10 their mantel piece . It would be a very
11 benign sort of attractive picture where you
12 wouldn't see anything.
13 Q. Who would request those pictures?
14 A. From time to time, people, men and
15 women would ask to have nice photographs of
16 them taken.
17 Q. And did Jeffrey Epstein request
18 those pictures?
19 A. I don't ever recall him asking me
20 to take pictures.
21 Q. Did you give him pictures of naked
22 females as a present?
23 A. I don't recall ever giving a
24 present of -- I don't know why a photograph
25 would constitute a gift.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 192 of 465
Page 192
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. Not as a gift.
3 Do you recall ever giving Jeffrey
4 Epstein pictures that you've taken of these
5 individuals in a naked state?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
7 form and foundation.
8 A. First of all, we've already
9 established that they are not naked state
10 photographs.
11 Q. A piece of them being naked as you
12 described.
13 A. I said they would be attractive as
14 you would see in mainstream magazines and
15 those pictures could be a picture of a hand
16 or a foot, they didn't necessarily
17 constitute -- I know where you are headed
18 with this and it's nowhere appropriate and
19 it's really unattractive.
20 Q. I'm not headed anywhere. I'm just
21 asking the questions. Did you give Jeffrey
22 Epstein any of these pictures that you took
23 of females in the state that you described?
24 A. I can't recall ever giving him
25 pictures but it is possible that I took
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 193 of 465
Page 193
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 pictures of people that would end up -- or a
3 friend of his that he would have -- not naked
4 or not inappropriate in any way, that he
5 might have somewhere in his house.
6 Q. Name for me all the individuals who
7 you took these pictures of?
8 A. It's entirely impossible for me to
9 name people. First of all, it was just -- it
10 would not be possible, I took thousands of
11 photos, not of people, I mostly take pictures
12 of landscapes and things. I have no
13 recollection specifically of people that I
14 took pictures of.
15 Q. So you can't remember, is it your
16 testimony you can't remember one person that
17 you took a picture of in either a naked or
18 semi naked state?
19 A. I seriously cannot recall. I just
20 don't recall.
21 Q. Did you take a picture of Virginia
22 Roberts either alone or with another
23 individual in a naked state?
24 A. I have never taken, I believe, any
25 pictures of two people in any type of
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 194 of 465
Page 194
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 situation, naked as you describe.
3 Q. Did you take a picture of Virginia
4 Roberts on her own without another individual
5 in it in a naked state?
6 A. I don't recall ever taking a
7 picture of Virginia -- naked, we are not
8 referring to someone with no clothing on at
9 all, we are referring to someone that could
10 be semi clad or could have a towel or we are
11 not referring to anything inappropriate.
12 Q. Was this a hobby of yours to take
13 pictures of the type that you are describing?
14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form.
15 A. I just testified, I didn't take
16 pictures of many people. My preference is
17 pictures for landscapes and for architectural
18 pieces.
19 Q. Where are those pictures today?
20 A. I have no idea.
21 Q. Do you have them in your home?
22 A. I do not.
23 Q. Do you have them on your computer?
24 A. I do not.
25 Q. What has Jeffrey Epstein told you
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 195 of 465
Page 195
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 about the allegations related to the criminal
3 investigation that he was involved in?
4 A. I really can't say, not because I
5 don't want to say but I just think of what he
6 has said to me over the course of this time.
7 Q. Did he explain it to you and
8 explain what the charges were against him?
9 A. I never had a detailed conversation
10 with him, as I recall.
11 Q. Not detailed, just did he explain
12 anything that was happening to him?
13 A. I haven't spoken to him for so
14 long. I can't possibly testify to what
15 conversations I had with him over the course
16 of time.
17 Q. Did he talk to you about any of the
18 girls that were making allegations against
19 him other than Virginia?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. You are talking about the police
23 records again, all of that?
24 Q. Yes.
25 A. I have never had a conversation
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 196 of 465
Page 196
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 about those things.
3 Q. What has Jeffrey Epstein told you
4 about Virginia Roberts?
5 A. That she is a liar.
6 Q. What does he base that on?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
8 form and foundation.
9 A. You would have to check with him.
10 I can tell you why I think she is a liar, I'm
11 happy to do that.
12 Q. Did he tell you he did not have
13 sexual relations with Virginia Roberts?
14 A. I can only testify what I know.
15 Q. I'm asking, has he told you that he
16 did not have sexual relations with Virginia
17 Roberts?
18 A. I can only tell you what I know
19 about Virginia Roberts, I cannot tell you
20 what he knows about Virginia Roberts.
21 Q. I'm asking, did he tell you that he
22 did not have sexual relations with Virginia
23 Roberts?
24 A. All he told me is she is a liar.
25 Q. That's all he said about Virginia
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 197 of 465
Page 197
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Roberts?
3 A. We went through all the lies that
4 you have sold to the papers and sold in
5 general and we have analyzed her lies and
6 your lies and your inappropriate behavior in
7 detail.
8 Q. Did he ever say that he did not
9 have sexual relations with Virginia Roberts?
10 A. I just testified that we went
11 through all of her lies.
12 Q. I understand what you said. I'm
13 asking you a question.
14 Did he ever tell you that he never
15 had sex with Virginia Roberts?
16 A. I don't recall whether he ever -- I
17 don't know I ever had that question. We
18 focused on the lies she did say she had with
19 him as relates to me. I don't remember
20 asking him about his problems with her. I'm
21 interested in what she says about myself.
22 Q. Did you also talk about what things
23 that Virginia Roberts was saying that were
24 true?
25 A. There isn't anything that she said
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 198 of 465
Page 198
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 that was true.
3 Q. Nothing she said that you are aware
4 of is true?
5 A. I think she is correct when she
6 talks about what her name is.
7 Q. Anything else?
8 A. I'm sure there must be one or two
9 other details but they are so far and few
10 between, I would have to look in detail at
11 all of her allegations to pinpoint what
12 possibly could be true.
13 Q. Did you ever ask Jeffrey if he had
14 sex with minors?
15 A. I have never been asked that
16 question.
17 Q. You never asked him that question.
18 What analysis did Jeffrey do to
19 determine that the statements Virginia
20 Roberts were making were lies?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
22 form and foundation.
23 A. Ask me again, please.
24 Q. What analysis did Jeffrey do to
25 determine that the statements that Virginia
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 199 of 465
Page 199
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Roberts were making were lies?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
4 form and foundation. And to the extent
5 that any of this answer calls for any
6 privileged communication, I'm
7 instructing, with myself or another
8 lawyer representing you or in any common
9 interest agreement, I'm instructing you
10 not to answer.
11 MS. McCAWLEY: The court ruled she
12 is entitled and you had to produce
13 documents about communications with
14 Jeffrey, that's what I'm asking about.
15 I'm not asking about communications with
16 lawyers.
17 Q. I'm asking what analysis did
18 Jeffrey do to determine that the statements
19 that Virginia Roberts was making were lies,
20 if you know?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: My objection is to
22 the extent she learned any of that
23 information as a result of either a
24 privileged communication from a lawyer,
25 one of her lawyers or a privileged
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 200 of 465

2 communications subject to a joint
3 defense agreement or common interest
4 agreement, I'm telling her not to
5 answer. To the extent she has
6 information outside of those things, she
7 is permitted to answer.
8 Q. Do you understand?
9 So if it was a conversation with a
10 lawyer which I'm not asking about, I don't
11 want you to tell me about your conversations
12 with lawyers.
13 I want you to tell me whether
14 Jeffrey Epstein ever told you what he
15 analyzed in order to determine which of -- of
16 what Virginia were saying were lies?
17 A. I do not know what he did, no.
18 So you agree she is lying, Singrid.
19 Q. I do not agree with that and I'm
20 asking the questions.
21 A. You just said her lies.
22 Q. I'm repeating a statement you made.
23 Q. Are you saying it's an obvious lie
24 that Jeffrey Epstein engaged in sexual
25 conduct with Virginia while Virginia was

2 underage?
3 A. I can only testify to what I saw
4 and what I was present for, so if you are
5 asking me what I saw then I am happy to
6 testify. I cannot testify to what somebody
7 else did or didn't do.
8 Q. Did you issue a statement
 in 2015, stating that
10 Virginia Roberts' claims were, quote, obvious
11 lies?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation.
14 Q. You can answer.
15 A. You need to reask me the question.
16 Q. Sure.
17 Did you issue a press statement
18 in
19 January of 2015, stating that Virginia
20 Roberts' claims were, quote, obvious lies?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
22 form and foundation.
23 A. Can you ask it a different way,
24 please?
25 Q. I will ask it again and you can
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 202 of 465
Page 202

2 listen carefully.
3 Did you issue a press statement
4 in
5 January of 2015, where you stated that
6 Virginia Roberts' claims were, quote, obvious
7 lies?
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
9 form and foundation.
10 A. So my lawyer,
11 instructed to issue a statement.
12 Q. Today, did you say that Virginia
13 lied about, quote, absolutely everything?
14 A. I said that there are some things
15 she may not have lied about.
16 Q. So are you saying it's an obvious
17 lie that Jeffrey Epstein engaged in sexual
18 contact with Virginia while Virginia was
19 underage?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. Can you ask the question again,
23 please?
24 Q. Are you saying it's an obvious lie
25 that Jeffrey Epstein engaged in sexual
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 203 of 465
Page 203

2 conduct with Virginia while Virginia was
3 underage?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
5 form and foundation.
6 Q. You can answer.
7 A. Try again, please.
8 Q. Are you saying that it's an obvious
9 lie that Jeffrey Epstein engaged in sexual
10 conduct with Virginia while Virginia was
11 underage?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation.
14 A. Again, I'm telling you, first of
15 all, it was a statement that was issued by my
16 lawyer and -- through my lawyer .
17 Q. I understand that. I'm asking you,
18 are you saying that it's an obvious lie that
19 Jeffrey Epstein engaged in sexual conduct
20 with Virginia while Virginia was underage.
21 Is that a lie?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
23 form and foundation.
24 Q. You can answer.
25 A. So I cannot testify to what
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 204 of 465
Page 204
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 and decided to put -- I can
3 testify to what Virginia's obvious lies are
4 as regards to me. I cannot make
5 representations about all the many lies she
6 may or may not have told about Jeffrey.
7 Q. So is Virginia lying when she says,
8 is it an obvious lie when she says that she
9 had sex with Jeffrey Epstein while she was
10 underage?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
12 form and foundation.
13 A. Again, I'm testifying to what I
14 know to be true. I can only testify to all
15 the many lies she told about me. I cannot
16 testify to what lies she told about somebody
17 else. Given she told so many about me, one
18 can probably infer she is lying about
19 everything.
20 Q. So you think she is lying when she
21 said she had sex with Jeffrey Epstein when
22 she was underage?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
24 form and foundation.
25 A. Again, I can only talk about what I
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 205 of 465
Page 205
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 can positively say myself, not what somebody
3 else is going to represent.
4 Q. When you were saying that she was,
5 her claims of having sex with Jeffrey Epstein
6 were obvious lies, are you saying she is
7 lying about engaging in sexual conduct with
8 Jeffrey Epstein when she was underage?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
10 form and foundation.
11 Q. You can answer.
12 A. Again, this was a statement that
13 was put out from my lawyer
 And I can only testify to
15 the obvious lies that she says about me. I
16 cannot make representations about lies she
17 says about someone else, but she lies so many
18 times about me, one can probably infer she is
19 lying about everything.
20 Q. So is she not lying when -- is she
21 telling the truth when she says she had sex
22 with Jeffrey Epstein when she was underage?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
24 form and foundation.
25 A. Again, I don't know how else to
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 206 of 465
Page 206
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 tell you, I can only talk about what I know
3 to be true. What I know is her story about
4 how she claims that initial situation
5 happened is so egregiously false and such a
6 giant fat enormous, repulsive, disgusting,
7 inappropriate, vile lie, that that I can
8 testify to.
9 Q. Was she lying when she said she met
10 you at Mar-a-Lago?
11 A. Again I already testified I don't
12 recall meeting her at Mar-a-Lago.
13 Q. We showed you a document where you
14 said you met her at Mar-a-Lago when she was
15 17, is that correct?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
17 form and foundation.
18 A. I think I already testified to
19 that. What I remembered based on all the
20 rubbish she has written and all the many
21 articles I have read, maybe in the moment
22 when I wrote that, have caused me to have
23 that but on reflection I don't recall it as I
24 sit here today.
25 Q. Are you saying that it was an
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 207 of 465
Page 207
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 obvious lie that you approached Virginia
3 while she was under age at Mar-a-Lago?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
5 form and foundation.
6 A. First of all, we can all agree
7 here, all of you sitting here that the lies
8 that you perpetrated in the press that she
9 was 15 and we should all agree now that that
10 is fake, a lie that was perpetrated between
11 all of you to make the story more exciting,
12 can we agree on that?
13 Q. That is not my question.
14 A. Can we agree she was not the age
15 she said and you put that in the press, that
16 is obviously, manifestly, absolutely, totally
17 a lie.
18 MS. McCAWLEY: I am going to put on
19 the record, Ms. Maxwell very
20 inappropriately and very harshly pounded
21 our law firm table in an inappropriate
22 manner. I ask she take a deep breath,
23 and calm down. I know this is a
24 difficult position but physical assault
25 or threats is not appropriate, so no
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 208 of 465
Page 208
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 pounding, no stomping, no, that's not
3 appropriate,.
4 A. Can we be clear, I didn't threaten
5 anybody.
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Stop, you made your
7 record, there is no dent in the table.
8 I don't see any chips. Can we take a
9 break now.
10 MS. McCAWLEY: I think it's
11 appropriate to take a break.
12 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: It's 1:56 and we
13 are off the record.
14 (Recess.)
15 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: It's now 2:13,
16 we're starting disk No. 5 and we are
17 back on the record.
18 Q. Ms. Maxwell, how old was Virginia
19 Roberts when you met her in Mar-a-Lago?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. I know today that she was 17 years
23 old.
24 Q. Are you saying that it's an obvious
25 lie that Virginia traveled on Jeffrey
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 209 of 465
Page 209
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Epstein's airplanes?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
4 form and foundation.
5 Q. You can answer.
6 A. Are you referring to my statement
7 where that says that?
8 Q. I'm referring to the language you
9 use in your statement that says, obvious
10 lies?
11 A. Can you read my entire statement?
12 Q. Sure, let me pass it out.
13 (Maxwell Exhibit 10, email,marked
14 for identification.)
15 Q. This is Bates GM 00068 and we will
16 mark it as -- what you have in front of you
17 is a statement at the top. This was produced
18 by your counsel, it is indicated Bates No.
19 GM 00068. At the top the date reflects
20 January 2, 2015 from, appears to be a
21 , subject line, is you and
22 then there is a number of individuals you can
23 see at the top that are copied on this that
24 is sent to and bcc'd on this statement.
25 The statement, there are two parts
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 210 of 465
Page 210
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 of it. There is an opening email that says,
3 please find an attached quotable statement on
4 behalf of Ms. Maxwell and there is more
5 language there and it's from and
6 then it says in the body of it, Jane Doe No.
7 3 or Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts so not a
8 new individual. The allegations made by, and
9 it says Victoria but I believe that means
10 Virginia Roberts, against Ghislaine Maxwell
11 are not true. The original allegations are
12 not new and have been fully responded to and
13 shown to be untrue. And the next paragraph
14 says, Each time the story is retold, it
15 changes with new salacious details about
16 public figures and world leaders and now it
17 is alleged by Ms. Roberts that
18 is involved in having sexual relations with
19 her which he denies. Ms. Roberts claims are
20 obvious lies and should be treated as such
21 and not publicized as news as they are
22 defamatory.
23 The last paragraph states,
24 Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the
25 lies and defamatory claims remains the same.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 211 of 465
Page 211
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Maxwell strongly denies allegations of the --
3 strongly denies allegations of an unsavory
4 nature which have appeared in the British
5 press and elsewhere and reserves her right to
6 seek redress at the repetition of such old
7 defamatory claims.
8 Are you saying that it's an obvious
9 lie that Virginia Roberts traveled on Jeffrey
10 Epstein's planes?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
12 form and foundation.
13 A. I'm saying what's an obvious lie
14 and I think we can all agree, you just had
15 the case tossed out by . He
16 just got removed from the case because you
17 put him in a case that he wasn't supposed to
18 be in so what was said about him is not true.
19 Q. Are you saying that it's an obvious
20 lie that Virginia Roberts traveled on Jeffrey
21 Epstein's plane?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
23 form and foundation.
24 A. You have given me plane records
25 that has her name on it but as I already
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 212 of 465
Page 212
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 testified those aren't federally mandated
3 things and I can see her name on it but
4 that's what I -- I told you I don't recall
5 her on any planes.
6 Q. Is is that one of Virginia's
7 obvious lies?
8 A. There are more obvious ones.
9 Q. Is that one of them?
10 A. I can't testify to her being on a
11 plane or not.
12 Q. So is that an obvious lie?
13 A. There are more obvious lies, like
14
15 Q. I understand there are more obvious
16 ones. I'm asking you, is the fact that she
17 said she traveled on Epstein's planes an
18 obvious lie?
19 A. I think we can probably say because
20 you see her name on a plane record and she
21 went from A to B, that would not be the
22 obvious lie that I would pick.
23 Q. What obvious lie were you picking
24 when you made this statement?
25 A. There are so many that I would be
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 213 of 465
Page 213
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 thrilled to go through all of them.
3 Q. Let's go through them.
4 What's the first one?
5 A. Her characterization of the first
6 meeting at Mar-a-Lago.
7 Q. What part of that was an obvious
8 lie?
9 A. The characterization that she said
10 that she said she was accosted. She looked
11 like, as best as I can recall, if I met her
12 in Mar-a-Lago as she claims, she worked at
13 Mar-a-Lago, she claims, and her statement she
14 worked at Mar-a-Lago, she would have been
15 dressed as all the spa people in Mar-a-Lago
16 would have been. It would have been
17 impossible to identify her as someone other
18 than someone who worked at a spa. She made
19 many claims, she has been a bathroom
20 attendant, front of house attendant, we don't
21 know what she was, so her obvious lies are
22 her contradictory of her own personal
23 statements within that.
24 Q. So what part of her statement
25 relating to Mar-a-Lago --
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 214 of 465
Page 214
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. I'm carrying on.
3 Q. I'm sorry. I thought you were
4 done.
5 A. Please. Her statement also that
6 she was driven by her father to Palm Beach.
7 She was driven by her mother, as a matter of
8 fact. Her whole entire characterization of
9 the first meeting with Jeffrey, as I was
10 outside speaking to her mother.
11 Q. Let me stop you there, so we don't
12 get too far ahead. Let me make sure I
13 understand your testimony.
14 The first, in the first piece when
15 you were talking, I believe you said and
16 correct me if I'm wrong, that her
17 characterization of the first meeting at
18 Mar-a-Lago was an obvious lie.
19 What part of that meeting was an
20 obvious lie?
21 A. By her own testimony, all her
22 various many different descriptions of what
23 she was or wasn't or where she was or wasn't,
24 they have all changed. She was either front
25 of house or bathroom attendant. I don't know
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 215 of 465
Page 215
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 what she was, so just by her own words, one
3 doesn't know what's true and what isn't true.
4 Q. Are you saying what position she
5 said she was working in, is that what you are
6 considering the obvious lie?
7 A. I said inconsistency within her own
8 statement from everything, so in the
9 beginning it starts off with different
10 statements.
11 Q. Then I believe you said the second
12 piece was that she was driven by her father?
13 A. I said she was driven by her
14 mother.
15 Q. That's the obvious lie?
16 A. It's an obvious lie to me.
17 Q. You said why don't you state it in
18 your own words but the characterization of
19 how she was with Jeffrey, what about that is
20 an obvious lie?
21 A. I was standing outside talking to
22 her mother so the entire story is a
23 fabrication.
24 Q. Did she not have sex with Jeffrey
25 Epstein during that first massage?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 216 of 465
Page 216
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
3 form and foundation.
4 A. I was talking to her mother so...
5 Q. Do you know whether that's an
6 obvious lie, whether she had sex in that room
7 or not?
8 A. Her story about what happened --
9 let's also be -- the story as first hit the
10 press was that somebody else led her to
11 Jeffrey's room, it was not me and then it
12 turned to being me so we have an obviously
13 important inconsistency, lie in my -- that's
14 how I would characterize a lie. It cannot be
15 me or somebody else, it can only be one or
16 the other.
17 Q. Who is the other person she said
18 took her to the room?
19 A. Why don't you ask her.
20 Q. I'm asking you.
21 A. How would I possibly know.
22 Q. You are saying that's a lie.
23 A. It was a lie in the papers, she
24 said it in the newspaper, it was in the
25 newspaper.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 217 of 465
Page 217
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. How do you know she wasn't
3 identifying you?
4 A. She said somebody.
5 Q. How do you know that somebody
6 wasn't you?
7 A. Why did it suddenly become me, why
8 not say it was me and be done with it.
9 Q. So it's a lie because she
10 originally may not have named you and then
11 named you later?
12 A. It's obviously inconsistent to
13 somebody who wasn't me.
14 Q. How do you know it wasn't you?
15 A. I know it wasn't me because I was
16 talking to her mother.
17 Q. But she then named you, is what you
18 are saying?
19 A. That's an obvious lie.
20 Q. She named you?
21 A. It's an obvious lie because I
22 wasn't even in the house.
23 Q. Is it an obvious -- who did lead
24 her up to Jeffrey's room while you were
25 talking to her mother?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 218 of 465
Page 218
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. You would have to ask Virginia, I
3 don't know if she was led up to his room.
4 Q. You were standing with the mother,
5 is that correct?
6 A. That's correct.
7 Q. Who was working at the house that
8 day?
9 A. .
10 A. Would typically lead
11 someone up to the room where Jeffrey was
12 having a massage?
13 A. I don't know she was led up to the
14 room to have a massage.
15 Q. She would have found her way on her
16 own?
17 A. I would suggest that that entire
18 story never happened at all in any of its
19 form.
20 Q. If you stood outside with the
21 mother, what did you think happened inside
22 then?
23 A. I believe that somebody, it wasn't
24 me, probably took her to meet
25 Jeffrey Epstein

1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 .
3 Q. Did Jeffrey tell you that?
4 A. No but that would have been a
5 normal interaction. I don't believe for a
6 second -- I know her entire characterization
7 didn't happen because I was outside talking
8 to her mother the entire time.
9 Q. Why would she have come for a
10 massage and not given a massage?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
12 form and foundation.
13 A. We are talking about her
14 characterization of the first time that she
15 came to the house.
16 Q. If I'm following you correctly,
17 you're saying she walked in and would have
18 gone to -- it's your assumption she would
19 have gone and talked to Jeffrey and left?
20 A. When I was working for Jeffrey,
21 typically he would meet someone before
22 getting a massage from them to see if he
23 wanted to have a massage from them,
24 typically.
25 Q. So he would not have someone come
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 220 of 465
Page 220
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 up to the room and start a massage?
3 A. He would not.
4 Q. So the young girls in the police
5 report who say they came over and were led up
6 to the room on the first day, would they be
7 wrong about that?
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
9 and foundation.
10 A. I can't comment what happened when
11 I was not at the house. I can only comment
12 when I was at the house.
13 Q. Was there ever a time where a woman
14 came to the house for the first time to give
15 a massage and Jeffrey had the massage that
16 day?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
18 form and foundation.
19 A. Can we talk about adult
20 professional masseuses, please?
21 Q. I'm asking, whether adult or
22 underage?
23 A. I'm not interested in talking about
24 underage. I can only testify to what I know,
25 professional masseuses, adult, I cannot

2 testify to anything else.
3 Q. Why can't you testify to an
4 underage girl that came over and was led up
5 to the room for a massage?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
7 form and foundation.
8 A. The police records you are
9 referring to?
10 Q. You are saying that didn't happen.
11 You're saying I can only testify to adults
12 that came for an interview and were led up to
13 the room. Why can't you testify to whether
14 an underage girl was brought in for an
15 interview and led up --
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
17 form and foundation.
18 Q. Go ahead.
19 A. Can you reask the question.
20 Q. Why can't you testify as to an
21 underage girl who came over for an interview
22 and then was then led up to the room for the
23 massage?
24 A. You've mangled your entire
25 question. Can you please reask that in a way
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 222 of 465

2 that I can answer it correctly?
3 Q. Why can you not testify as to
4 whether an underage girl, you said you can
5 testify as to females that were over the age
6 of 18, why can't you testify as to whether an
7 underage girl came over for an interview and
8 on the same day --
9 A. I don't know what you mean by
10 interview.
11 Q. You just said that Jeffrey Epstein
12 interviewed, it was your word, interviewed
13 the masseuses before they gave massages, is
14 that correct?
15 A. The word interview is making me --
16 I'm English, so you could have some
17 difficulty understanding the way I
18 communicate.
19 Q. I'm using your word.
20 A. Then I will reuse it a different
21 word. He would meet them because receiving a
22 massage is something you want to make sure
23 you are comfortable with the person and so
24 interview is not the correct word but you
25 would meet them to have a conversation with
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 223 of 465
Page 223
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 them to see if you want to have a massage
3 with that person.
4 Q. Did Jeffrey Epstein ever meet an
5 underaged girl and on the same day receive a
6 massage from that girl?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
8 form and foundation.
9 A. I can't possibly testify to what
10 happened after I was not at the house.
11 Q. If you are aware, at any time you
12 were at the house, did you ever see that?
13 MS. MENNINGER: Let her finish the
14 question.
15 A. I can only testify to people who
16 were adult professional masseuses who came to
17 the house. I cannot testify to something I'm
18 not party to and don't know about. I can
19 only testify to what I saw. So when
20 professional adult masseuse, male and/or
21 females would come to the house, typically
22 when I was there, typically he would meet
23 with them prior, to have a conversation with
24 them about their experience, whatever, to
25 decide whether it would then A, if he had
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 224 of 465
Page 224
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 time for a massage at that time or B, whether
3 he could have a massage at that moment.
4 Q. Was Virginia an adult when she came
5 over, was she over 18?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
7 form and foundation.
8 A. I think we established, as of
9 today, we are all aware, everyone in this
10 room that she was 17.
11 Q. So you have been present when a
12 minor was brought over for a massage for
13 Jeffrey?
14 A. Can I say, as you are able to have
15 a massage at 17, so she came as a masseuse.
16 Q. I'm not saying whether or not you
17 are able to. I'm saying you've been present
18 at Jeffrey's home when an underage minor has
19 come over to give him a massage?
20 A. That's just not how that works.
21 You are able to be a masseuse at 17 so she
22 came to give -- for a massage, at 17 you are
23 able to come and give a massage.
24 Q. I'm not asking whether she is able
25 to do it. I'm asking whether you were
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 225 of 465
Page 225
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 present at the home when a girl under the age
3 of 18 came over for the purposes of giving a
4 massage?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
6 form and foundation.
7 Q. You can answer.
8 A. You can be a professional masseuse
9 at 17 in Florida, so as far as I am aware, a
10 professional masseuse showed up for a
11 massage. There is nothing inappropriate or
12 incorrect about that and your
13 mischaracterization of it, I think is
14 unfortunate.
15 Q. How many teenagers did he have that
16 were professional masseuses that worked in
17 his home?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
19 form and foundation.
20 Q. How many?
21 A. First of all, I am not aware of
22 teenagers who worked in his home.
23 Q. You are aware of Virginia Roberts
24 and you've stated she was 17 and she worked
25 for him, correct?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 226 of 465
Page 226
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. No. I did not state that at all,
3 you are mischaracterizing my words and what I
4 said.
5 What I said was that we can all
6 agree and I think at this point there is not
7 one person in this room, however much you
8 would like her to be younger, to say she was
9 not 17 because that has been a very offensive
10 thing that you have all done. So she was 17.
11 At 17 you are allowed to be a professional
12 masseuse and as far as I'm concerned, she was
13 a professional masseuse. There is nothing
14 inappropriate or incorrect about her coming
15 at that time to give a massage. Her entire
16 characterization of her first time at the
17 house was to me an obvious lie, given it was
18 impossible for her entire story to take place
19 given I was speaking to her mother the entire
20 she was at the house.
21 Q. So it was impossible that day, that
22 first day she came and you were speaking to
23 the mother, for Virginia Roberts to have had
24 sex with Jeffrey Epstein during the time that
25 you were outside with her mother?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 227 of 465
Page 227
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
3 form and foundation.
4 A. You, again, are completely
5 mischaracterizing. I can only testify to
6 what I heard obvious lies about me and her
7 obvious lies about me are that she, as you
8 put out to the papers and every other which
9 way, went upstairs with her, didn't happen.
10 So that to me is an absolute, obvious lie. I
11 also don't believe that her -- her
12 mischaracterization of the length of time she
13 was there because as I recall, she just met
14 with Jeffrey and then left with her mother.
15 That's my recollection.
16 Q. So you were standing outside the
17 entire time that Virginia was in the house,
18 is that correct?
19 A. That is correct.
20 Q. So can you testify as to whether or
21 not, do you know either from Jeffrey or any
22 other source whether or not Virginia Roberts
23 had sex with Jeffrey on that first day that
24 she was at the house?
25 A. We can categorically state,
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 228 of 465
Page 228
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 absolutely 1000 percent that she did not have
3 any type of sexual relations as described by
4 you in your court papers that took place
5 because those allegedly according to her lies
6 involved some aspect of me.
7 As I was standing outside with her
8 mother the entire time, her entire story is a
9 lie. Therefore, to ask me what she did or
10 didn't do during that time, I can only
11 testify to what she said about me, which was
12 1000 percent false.
13 Q. So let's not take the first time,
14 let's take the next time she comes.
15 A. No no, how can do you that, when
16 the basis of this entire horrible story that
17 you have put out is based on this first
18 appalling story that was written, repeated,
19 multiply by the press that lied about her
20 age, lied about the first time she came, lied
21 about and characterized the entire first
22 time. I have been so absolutely appalled by
23 her story and appalled by the entire
24 characterization of it and I apologize
25 sincerely for my banging at the table
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 229 of 465
Page 229
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 earlier, I hope you accept my apology. It's
3 borne out of years of feeling the pressure of
4 this entire lie that she has perpetrated from
5 our first time and whilst I recognize that
6 was -- I hope you forgive me sincerely
7 because it was just the length of time that
8 that terrible story has been told and retold
9 and rehashed when I know it to be 100 percent
10 false.
11 Q. So not the first time she came, but
12 the second time she came or the third time or
13 any time she came, did you ever participate
14 in a massage with her in Jeffrey Epstein's
15 room?
16 A. I have never participated at any
17 time with Virginia in a massage with Jeffrey.
18 Q. Have you ever participated at any
19 time with Virginia in any kind of sexual
20 contact or sexual touching with Jeffrey and
21 Virginia?
22 A. I have not.
23 Q. So we were going through the list
24 of obvious lies and you were talking about
25 the first time which I believe we have
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 230 of 465
Page 230
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 completed but you can add to that if you need
3 to.
4 What other obvious lies did
5 Virginia Roberts tell that you were referring
6 to in your statement?
7 A. Oh my goodness. Well, I think we
8 can totally cover the story, the
9 story that I flew him with and
10 there was a dinner with other people and that
11 entire thing is 100 percent fictitious. I
12 have testified for the record and I'm happy
13 to do it again, that I have never flown
14 myself as a pilot in a helicopter at
15 any time, anyplace, at any time, to any part
16 of the world.
17 Q. What other obvious lies were you
18 referring to?
19 A. She was referring to , she
20 is referring to a bunch of people. I don't
21 believe ever came to the island at
22 any time ever. I don't even know
23 actually.
24 Q. Just one moment, I want to hear all
25 of them, but when you say you don't believe
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 231 of 465
Page 231
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 ever came to the island, do you know
3 whether ever came to the island?
4 A. never came to the island.
5 Q. How do you know that?
6 A. Jeffrey doesn't know him, I don't
7 know him and I think had -- I don't
8 think -- had gone to the island
9 during the period when I would have been
10 involved in organizing a trip, I would have
11 been aware of it.
12 Q. So go ahead, you had another one.
13 A. It would be easier if I could see,
14 do you mind if a take a reference at some of
15 these newspaper articles or you just want me
16 to go from memory.
17 Her entire characterization of what
18 took place in London at my house with
19
20 Q. Was it an obvious lie that she was
21 at your house in London?
22 A. We can't really establish the
23 photograph and all that. I don't know if
24 that's true, if that's a real picture or not.
25 Q. So you dispute that you were
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 232 of 465
Page 232
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 actually photographed in your town home in
3 London --
4 A. I don't recognize that picture.
5 I'm not sure if that's a real picture or not.
6 Q. And have you talked to
7 about that picture?
8 A. We discussed Virginia's entire tail
9 and he asked me if he even knew her.
10 Q. So did tell you that
11 he did not have sex with Virginia Roberts?
12 A. He doesn't even know who Virginia
13 Roberts is.
14 Q. Did he tell you that he didn't have
15 sex with her?
16 A. It would be difficult to have sex
17 with someone you don't know.
18 Q. He may not remember her?
19 A. I think the inference is he didn't
20 know who she was, he didn't have any
21 recollection of her whatsoever.
22 Q. Has ever come to your
23 London town home?
24 A. Yes. Ever being the entire time I
25 owned my house, yes.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 233 of 465
Page 233
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Can I go on on her obvious lies?
3 Q. If you have more.
4 A. I have -- her entire
5 characterization -- I took her shopping into
6 Burberry and bought her a very expensive
7 dress and if this photo were real and if this
8 is -- I would never -- the outfit doesn't
9 work at all so --
10 Q. Do you not remember taking her
11 shopping or are you saying it's an obvious
12 lie, you know you did not take her shopping?
13 A. I did not take her shopping. I did
14 not by her a $5,000 handbag.
15 Q. Did Jeffrey by her a $5,000
16 handbag?
17 A. Her accusation was that I did.
18 Q. Do you know if Jeffrey bought her a
19 handbag during that trip to London?
20 A. I don't know what he did. She
21 accused me, I can't physically remember
22 buying a $5,000 not for her, not for anyone,
23 not for me.
24 Q. Did you ever go shopping with
25 Virginia?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 234 of 465
Page 234
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. I don't recall ever shopping with
3 Virginia.
4 Q. Did you have more to go over or did
5 you want me to ask my questions?
6 A. The entire characterization of what
7 took place in my house in London would have
8 been impossible.
9 Q. Can I ask, do you still have it,
10 the picture of the London town home with you
11 in it, Giuffre 00407.
12 As you are looking at this picture,
13 Ms. Maxwell, as I'm looking at it it's on the
14 right-hand side, there appears to be a
15 picture hanging on the wall, do you recall
16 that in your London town home?
17 A. It's a little difficult to see.
18 Q. Do you recall having a picture on
19 the wall there by the room where you're
20 standing?
21 A. I do have a picture.
22 Q. Do you recall on the left-hand side
23 having a railing that looks like that with
24 sort of a bubble wood top?
25 A. I do.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 235 of 465
Page 235
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. So are you saying that it's an
3 obvious lie that Virginia's statement that
4 she had sex with is an obvious
5 lie?
6 A. What I'm representing is that her
7 entire ludicrous and absurd story of what
8 took place in my house is an obvious lie.
9 Q. Including she had sex with
10
11 A. She claimed things took place in my
12 bathroom in London. Her characterizations is
13 just not possible.
14 Q. So you're saying it's an obvious
15 lie -- that she was telling an obvious lie
16 when she said she had sex with ?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
18 form and foundation. The witness
19 answered the question.
20 A. I'm saying within the context of
21 all the stories she told, this particular
22 story -- back up, she claimed we went out at
23 night.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 236 of 465

2 . She characterized
3 that .
4 .
5 She then characterized things took
6 place in my bathroom in the bathtub itself.
7 The tub is too small for any type of activity
8 whatsoever.
9 Q.
11 A.
13 Q. That would be
14
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Are you saying that it was an
17 obvious lie when Virginia said that you made
18 her dress up in a school girl outfit?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
20 form and foundation.
21 A. I already testified that, first of
22 all, I don't know what you are taking about,
23 I already testified I didn't get her outfits
24 and all of that.
25 Q. Is it an obvious lie that Virginia
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 237 of 465
Page 237
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 was paid to go to give a massage to
3 ?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
5 form and foundation.
6 A. I cannot testify to what Virginia
7 did outside of -- I can't testify to what she
8 did, who she gave massages to.
9 Q. So you don't know on that one?
10 A. Of course I don't know.
11 Q. Do you agree that it's
12 psychologically harmful to have sex with a
13 minor?
14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
15 and foundation.
16 A. What are you asking me?
17 Q. I'm asking if is it psychologically
18 harmful for an adult to have sex with a
19 minor?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. I don't know what you are asking.
23 This has nothing to do with Virginia Roberts.
24 Q. It does.
25 A. How does it?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 238 of 465
Page 238
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. I ask the questions, you answer.
3 If you can't answer, you can say I don't
4 know.
5 But my question is, do you agree
6 that it's psychologically harmful to have sex
7 with a minor?
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
9 form and foundation.
10 A. Are you giving me a random question
11 and as not relates to this case and not
12 relates to anything. It's obviously not
13 something that you want to have happen.
14 Q. Do you agree that Jeffrey Epstein
15 has harmed many minors by having sex with
16 them?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
18 form and foundation.
19 A. I can't testify to what Jeffrey did
20 or didn't do. I have no knowledge of what
21 you are asking me.
22 Q. If Jeffrey had sex with minors,
23 would you agree that that could harm a minor?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
25 and foundation.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 239 of 465
Page 239
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. Again, I am not testifying to what
3 Jeffrey did or did not do because I cannot.
4 Q. You don't know whether Jeffrey
5 Epstein ever had sex with a minor?
6 A. Again, I cannot testify to what
7 Jeffrey did or didn't do. I cannot.
8 Q. You never observed him having sex
9 with a minor?
10 A. I never observed Jeffrey having sex
11 with a minor.
12 Q. Do you agree that calling a sex
13 abuse victim a liar when she speaks about her
14 abuse can cause psychological harm?
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
16 form and foundation.
17 A. Can you repeat the question.
18 Q. Do you agree calling a sex abuse
19 victim when she speaks about her abuse can
20 cause psychological harm?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
22 and foundation.
23 A. Say it again.
24 Q. Do you agree that calling a sexual
25 abuse victim a liar can cause psychological
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 240 of 465
Page 240

2 harm.
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
4 form and foundation.
5 A. I would like to say all the
6 terrible things Virginia Roberts said about
7 me is extremely harmful and you should turn
8 that around. All the lies she has said and
9 you have backed her on have been extremely
10 damaging to me.
11 So what I can testify to is that
12 somebody who has made these outrageous
13 allegations and who is a serious liar and
14 that I know for a fact is a liar, that I can
15 testify is damaging to me.
16 Q. Do you agree that calling a sexual
17 abuse victim a liar when she speaks out about
18 her abuse can cause psychological harm?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: Are you asking a
20 hypothetical question?
21 MS. McCAWLEY: Yes.
22 A. You are asking me to speculate?
23 Q. I'm not asking you to speculate .
24 If somebody is a sexual abuse victim --
25 A. I can't testify to what some random
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 241 of 465
Page 241
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 hypothetical person that you are asking me to
3 speculate on their mental state or health
4 versus speculative statement. I can't do
5 that, that's just not right.
6 Q. Do you agree that by calling
7 Virginia Roberts a liar when she was subject
8 to sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein can cause
9 psychological harm?
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
11 form and foundation. Assumes facts not
12 in evidence.
13 A. I can only tell you about what I
14 know of Virginia's lies. She lied
15 repeatedly, often and I know for a fact she
16 is a liar so I can only testify to what I
17 know and the fact that she has lied about me
18 from the beginning to the end and repeatedly
19 causes me to question anything that she may
20 feel.
21 Q. Is it an obvious lie you had sex
22 toys in Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach house?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
24 form and foundation.
25 A. Can you repeat the question,
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 242 of 465
Page 242
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 please?
3 Q. Is it an obvious lie that you had
4 sex toys in Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach
5 house?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
7 form and foundation.
8 A. Did Virginia say that?
9 Q. I'm asking you a question.
10 Is it an obvious lie that you had
11 sex toys in Jeffrey Epstein's house?
12 A. I don't recall any sex toys.
13 Q. If someone said had you sex toys,
14 would that be an obvious lie?
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
16 form and foundation.
17 A. Like I said -- can you be more
18 specific about the house or whatever, what
19 exactly you are referring to, what's a sex
20 toy?
21 Q. Yes. How would you define a sex
22 toy?
23 A. No. I need you to define a sex
24 toy, I don't have enough knowledge of sex
25 toys.

2 Q. I will define it based on the
3 dictionary's definition, which is an object
4 or device used to sexually stimulate or
5 enhance sexual pleasure.
6 A. What's your question, please?
7 Q. The question is, is it an obvious
8 lie that you had sex toys in Jeffrey
9 Epstein's Palm Beach house?
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objection.
11 Q. You can answer.
12 A. Like I said, I do not have any
13 recollection of sex toys in Jeffrey's house.
14 Q. Is it a lie, is it an obvious lie
15 that you took pictures of nude girls?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
17 and foundation.
18 A. We already covered this. Girls we
19 are not referring to -- I can only testify to
20 taking pictures of adult people and I already
21 testified they are not nude, per se. That
22 every picture that I ever took and which they
23 were very limited, always by request, the
24 people would be covered or it would be a hand
25 or a foot. There was never any pictures that
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 244 of 465
Page 244

2 I took of people would only have been
3 mainstream type magazine type photos and any
4 photos I took could have been very happily
5 and expected to be displayed on your parents'
6 mantel piece or grandparents' mantel piece.
7 Q. Is it a lie that you approached
8 females to bring them to Jeffrey Epstein?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
10 form and foundation.
11 A. Please ask the question, again.
12 Q. Sure. Is it a lie that you
13 approached females to bring them to Jeffrey
14 Epstein?
15 A. I don't know what you are asking
16 me.
17 Q. I'm asking you, if it's a lie that
18 you approached females to bring them to
19 Jeffrey Epstein?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. You are not asking me a good
23 question, sorry.
24 Q. You don't get to choose the
25 questions.

2 A. I would like to answer your
3 questions but you are not asking me a
4 question that I can answer.
5 Q. What about that is causing you
6 pause where you can't answer the question?
7 A. You are trying to trap me and
8 that's not fair, so I already testified that
9 I hire people across the board, so I would
10 hire architects, decorators, pool people,
11 exercise instructors, gardeners, cooks,
12 chefs, cleaning people. So I, in the course
13 of a very long time when I would hire people
14 I hired people to work for Jeffrey. So I'm
15 happy to testify to hiring people for every
16 possible conceivable proper job that you
17 could conceive of within the context of
18 Jeffrey's life and homes.
19 Q. Is it a lie that you approached
20 females to bring them to Jeffrey Epstein for
21 the purpose of performing massages?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
23 form and foundation.
24 A. Again, I have already testified
25 that part of the job that I had was to hire
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 246 of 465
Page 246
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 lots of different types of people. In terms
3 of whatever -- very small part of my job,
4 Jeffrey enjoyed getting massages. I think
5 that is something we can all agree in this
6 room and within the context of that, very
7 infrequently I would go to spas and myself
8 happily receive a professional nonsexual
9 massage from a man and/or from a woman and if
10 that massage was something that I thought was
11 something that was good, I would ask if that
12 man or woman would come back and does home
13 visits. If that person said that they did,
14 they would sometimes come, from time to time,
15 not always, come back to the house to perform
16 a nonsexual professional male or female
17 massage.
18 Q. Were any of the exercise
19 instructors you hired under the age of 18?
20 A. Again, I don't hire, we've already
21 established that I don't hire people. I
22 interview people to see if they are competent
23 in the job that they do and/or whether they
24 are someone who seemed that they can do home
25 visits.

2 At the point where I think that
3 there is somebody that has, can be either
4 whatever the job may be, pool, gardener, chef
5 and/or exercise instructor and I think they
6 could be good at whatever it is at whatever
7 skill that they had and they did a home visit
8 which would obviously be mandatory and Mr.
9 Epstein would meet with them and decide if he
10 wanted to have whatever skill it was that he
11 would do it and then he would then either
12 have them come back or hire them.
13 Q. Were there any exercise instructors
14 that worked at the home that were under the
15 age of 18?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
17 form and foundation.
18 A. Again, I keep coming back to this,
19 that the people that I employed or -- not the
20 right word, the people I would meet to come
21 and work at the house, under any guise
22 whatsoever, again, from any of the many
23 positions that I filled, were all over --
24 were adults.
25 Q. When you say adults, over the age
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 248 of 465
Page 248
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 of 18?
3 A. I think we can establish what adult
4 would be.
5 Q. You never interviewed or I know you
6 don't want to use the word hired, whatever
7 your role was, you brought in an exercise
8 instructor that was under the age of 18 to
9 work at the house?
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
11 and foundation.
12 A. I have already testified that what
13 I was responsible for was to find people who
14 had competencies in whatever area I was
15 looking for. The competencies I was looking
16 for were professional and adult.
17 Q. So there was no exercise instructor
18 that worked at the Palm Beach house or the
19 New York house or the New Mexico house or the
20 USVI under the age of 18?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
22 form and foundation.
23 A. I can only testify to when I was at
24 the house.
25 Q. Yes.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 249 of 465
Page 249
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. I can only testify to the years
3 when I was present.
4 Q. Right.
5 A. And I can also only testify to
6 people I personally either met and/or worked
7 with and/or invited, to find the correct
8 word, I don't know what the correct word is,
9 to come to do exercise or whatever it was at
10 the house.
11 Of the people that I, male and/or
12 female that I brought were all appropriate
13 and age appropriate adults.
14 Q. Over the age of 18?
15 A. We've established them as an adult.
16 Q. You are saying appropriate adults,
17 so we are clear, you didn't hire or bring in
18 or know of any exercise instructors that were
19 under the age of 18 at any of those homes?
20 A. I am also testifying that when I
21 was present at the house and with the people
22 that I brought in, were all age appropriate
23 adults.
24 Q. How do you define age appropriate
25 adults, is that over the age of 18, can we
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 250 of 465
Page 250
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 agree to that?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
4 form and foundation.
5 Q. Are they under the age of 18?
6 A. We already established that you can
7 be a masseuse in Florida at age 17. That
8 does not make it inappropriate.
9 A. I'm not saying appropriate or
10 inappropriate. I'm just asking if there were
11 any exercise instructors that were under the
12 age of 18.
13 A. I am not aware if anybody was but I
14 don't want to full out and say you oh she
15 said, we already established you can be a 17
16 year old masseuse and have it not be
17 something that is not appropriate. So when
18 you say that and then you go, well, you come
19 back and say something, now we can establish
20 that Virginia was 17 but you can be a 17 year
21 old legal masseuse, but I am not aware to
22 your point.
23 Q. Who were the other 17 year old
24 masseuses that you were aware of?
25 A. I am not aware of any.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 251 of 465
Page 251
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. Were there any 16 year year old
3 masseuse that you are aware of?
4 A. I am not aware.
5 Q. Any 15?
6 A. I just want to be clear. The only
7 person that I am aware of who claims to have
8 been a -- we have to -- we established
9 Virginia now is 17, given she has changed her
10 age so many times. The only person that I am
11 aware of that was a masseuse at the time when
12 I was present in the house was Virginia.
13 Q. Is it an obvious lie that Jeffrey
14 Epstein had a sexual preference for underage
15 miners?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
17 form and foundation.
18 A. Can you ask the question again?
19 Q. It is it an obvious lie that
20 Jeffrey Epstein had a sexual preference for
21 underage minors?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
23 form and foundation.
24 A. Can you ask the question again?
25 Q. Is it an obvious lie that Jeffrey
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 252 of 465
Page 252
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Epstein had a sexual preference for underage
3 minors?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
5 and foundation.
6 A. I cannot testify to what
7 Jeffrey's --
8 Q. You don't know his preference?
9 A. You handed me a stack of papers
10 from the police reports and that's what I've
11 read but I have no knowledge, direct
12 knowledge, of what you are referencing.
13 Q. So you don't know, you don't know
14 in your own mind that Jeffrey Epstein had a
15 sexual preference for underage minors, is
16 that correct?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
18 form and foundation.
19 Q. Is that correct?
20 A. Please ask the question again.
21 Q. You don't know in your own mind
22 that Jeffrey Epstein had a sexual preference
23 for underage minors?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
25 form and foundation. You have to pause,
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 253 of 465
Page 253
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 let me object, answer the question.
3 Listen to her question, pause, I object,
4 you answer.
5 Q. So you don't know in your own mind
6 that Jeffrey Epstein had a sexual preference
7 for underage minors?
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
9 form and foundation.
10 Q. You can answer.
11 A. I cannot tell you what Jeffrey's
12 story is. I'm not able to.
13 Q. Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme
14 to recruit underage girls to use them for
15 purposes of sexual massages?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
17 form and foundation.
18 A. Can you ask me again, please?
19 Q. Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme
20 to recruit underage girls to recruit them for
21 sexual massages?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
23 form and foundation.
24 A. Can you ask it a different way?
25 Q. Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 254 of 465
Page 254

2 to recruit underage girls for sexual
3 massages?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
5 form and foundation.
6 Q. If you know.
7 A. I don't know what you are talking
8 about.
9 Q. Is it an obvious lie that Virginia
10 Giuffre was a minor the first time she was
11 taken to Jeffrey Epstein's house?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation.
14 A. So we've already established that
15 Virginia was 17 and we have established that
16 her mother brought her to the house and that
17 she came as a masseuse, age 17, which is
18 legal in Florida.
19 Q. Would Jeffrey Epstein's assistants
20 arrange times for underage girls to come to
21 the house for sexual massages?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
23 form and foundation.
24 A. What are you talking about?
25 Q. Sure. Would Jeffrey Epstein's
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 255 of 465
Page 255
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 assistants, I think earlier you mentioned, we
3 talked about who worked in the
4 role as an assistant or .
5 Would Jeffrey Epstein's assistants arrange
6 times for underage girls to come over the
7 house for sexual massages?
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
9 form and foundation.
10 A. Again, I read the police reports so
11 this is all happening according to the police
12 reports when I am no longer at the house so I
13 can't testify to what Jeffrey's assistants
14 did when this kind of activity as alleged in
15 the reports.
16 Q. So you don't know?
17 A. No.
18 Q. Would Jeffrey Epstein's assistants,
19 meaning or any
20 other assistant that you are aware of from
21 the time you worked there take nude
22 photographs of underage girls?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
24 and foundation.
25 A. During what period of time?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 256 of 465
Page 256
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. During any period of time you
3 worked, did you observe that?
4 A. I did not observe any such
5 photographs.
6 Q. Are you aware if they took those
7 kinds of photos?
8 A. I am not aware.
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Can we take a
10 five-minute break.
11 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: It's 2:58 and we
12 are off the record.
13 (Recess.)
14 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: It's now 3:10.
15 We're starting disk No. 6 and we are
16 back on the record.
17 Q. Ms. Maxwell, was it an obvious lie
18 when Virginia said she was sent to Thailand
19 by Epstein in September of 2002?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. I have no knowledge of Virginia
23 being sent to Thailand.
24 But may I say something?
25 Q. There is not a question pending
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 257 of 465
Page 257
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 unless you want to clarify something.
3 Did you want to clarify that?
4 A. No, I just wanted to say something.
5 Q. Is it an obvious lie when Virginia
6 said she was given instructions to maintain
7 telephone contact with you while she was in
8 Thailand?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
10 form and foundation.
11 A. Can you repeat the question?
12 Q. Is it an obvious lie when Virginia
13 said she was given instructions to maintain
14 telephone contact with you when she was in
15 Thailand?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objection.
17 A. I have no idea what instructions
18 Virginia was given, if any, when she went to
19 Thailand.
20 Q. So you know she went to Thailand?
21 A. I know she claimed she went to
22 Thailand from having read it but given that
23 she lied about everything it's hard to know
24 what is true and not true.
25 Q. Would it make any sense for her to
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 258 of 465
Page 258
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 be in contact with you, would there be any
3 reason why she needed to be in contact with
4 you?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
6 form and foundation.
7 A. When are we talking about?
8 Q. When she went to Thailand.
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objection.
10 Q. In 2002, would there be any reason
11 for her to remain in contact with you?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation.
14 A. Can you ask the question again,
15 please?
16 Q. Would there be any reason for
17 Virginia to maintain contact with you in 2002
18 when she went to Thailand?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objection.
20 A. First of all, I didn't know that
21 she went to Thailand. I had had nothing to
22 do with her trip to go to Thailand and there
23 would absolutely no reason for her to be in
24 touch with me, whatsoever.
25 Q. Did you ever have a phone number
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 259 of 465
Page 259

2 that was
3 A. I did.
4 Q. Was that a cell phone number?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Is that your current cell phone
7 number?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. I'm going to mark a couple of
10 things here?
11 (Maxwell Exhibit 11, photos, marked
12 for identification.)
13 THE WITNESS: Can I say something
14 now?
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: No.
16 THE WITNESS: Will you let me know
17 when I can?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: When she asks you a
19 question:
20 Q. So we've marked this as Exhibit 11.
21 I'm showing you what's been marked as Exhibit
22 11 which is Giuffre 003191 and 003192.
23 Can you take a look at that
24 document for me. Is that number that you
25 just identified the as being

2 your cell phone number, is that number on
3 this document?
4 A. It is.
5 Q. And do you know who authored this
6 document?
7 A. I do not.
8 Q. Who is
9 A. I don't know who is on this
10 document because I don't know what this
11 document is.
12 Q. Do you know someone by the name of
13
14 A. I do know someone by the name of

16 Q. Would he know your phone number?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form.
18 A. I have to idea.
19 Q. Why would Virginia be instructed to
20 call Ms. Maxwell at your number on this form?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
22 form and foundation.
23 A. I don't know what this document is.
24 I don't know when it was done, I don't know
25 anything about it other than I can see it has

2 my name and my number on it.
3 Q. So -- you said -- is he
4 employed by Mr. Epstein?
5 A. Again, it is not the only one
6 on the planet.
7 Q. I understand.
8 Do you know a that is employed
9 by Mr. Epstein?
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
11 form and foundation.
12 A. Can you ask me the question again?
13 Q. Do you know someone by the name of
14 that was employed by Mr. Epstein back in
15 2002?
16 A. I do know somebody who was employed
17 by Mr. Epstein known as
18 Q. Do you recognize the other numbers
19 listed at the top of this document?
20 A. I do not.
21 Q. Would you have known cell
22 number at that time in 2002?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
24 form and foundation.
25 A. I have no idea.

2 Q. Can I ask you to turn to the next
3 page, please.
4 Do you know who
5 is who is mentioned on this document?
6 A. I do not.
7 Q. If you look on the bottom lines of
8 the document, it says, Still in Thailand
9 during your stay, if she is, she will be
10 staying at the same hotel.
11 Do you recall ever giving Virginia
12 instructions to meet a girl in Thailand?
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
14 form and foundation.
15 A. I have already testified that I
16 didn't even know that Virginia was going to
17 Thailand.
18 Q. So you didn't give her instructions
19 to meet a girl in Thailand?
20 A. Like I said, I didn't even know she
21 was going to Thailand.
22 Q. Do you know whether Jeffrey Epstein
23 would have given her instructions to meet a
24 girl in Thailand?

2 form and foundation.
3 A. I cannot possibly tell you what
4 Jeffrey did or didn't do. I wouldn't know.
5 Q. Do you know whether Jeffrey Epstein
6 paid for Virginia to go to Thailand?
7 A. Again, I wouldn't know if he did.
8 (Maxwell Exhibit 12, documents,
9 marked for identification)
10 Q. I'm going to direct -- you can take
11 a look at it and then I'm going to direct
12 your attention to a couple of pages.
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: So the record should
14 be clear, this exhibit which is 12 is
15 375, 6, 7, 8, 9, 80, 1, and then skips
16 to 919, 920, 921, 922, 923, 924, 925 and
17 926.

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Are you asking her
3 to compare the documents or are you

7 look at the doubts and tell me if she
8 recalls that she traveling with

2 Q. Is it your testimony that
3 knows Jeffrey Epstein through the work
4 that she does for you?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
6 form and foundation.
7 A. I don't recollect, and I don't
8 recollect how I met and I can't testify

15 conversation with Jeffrey about ?
16 A. In what context.
17 Q. In any context. Have you ever
18 talked to Jeffrey Epstein about ?
19 A. works for me so it's entirely
20 possible that in the course of conversations
21 since 2002, 2003 that a conversation in which
22 name would have come up is entirely
23 possible.
24 Q. I provided you with and I'm sorry,

2 statement that was issued by that
3 should be a single page still in your stack
4 of exhibits there.
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Exhibit 10.
6 Q. Did you authorize to issue
7 that statement on your behalf in January of
8 2015?
9 A. I already testified that that was
10 done by my lawyers.
11 Q. So did you authorize your lawyers
12 to issue a statement on your behalf through
13 in January of 2015?
14 A. It was determined that I had to
15 make a statement in the United Kingdom
16 because of the appalling lies and I just
17 thought of some new ones.
18 Virginia's statement that I
19 celebrated her 16 birthday with her. We can
20 all agree that that's entirely impossible. I
21 didn't meet her until she was 17 and other
22 lies she perpetrated that she had a diary and
23 we all know is a complete fake. That's not a
24 diary. It was just a book she was writing
25 that you helped sell to the press, as if it
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 274 of 465
Page 274
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 was a diary, when it was just a story that
3 she is writing of fiction, fictional story
4 for money.
5 Q. How did you arrive at the words
6 that were put in that statement?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm going to object
8 and instruct you to the extent this
9 calls for any privileged communications
10 between yourself and or
11 another lawyer representing you, we're
12 asserting privilege. If you can answer
13 that without that, feel free to answer.
14 Q. So what your counsel is saying, and
15 I will exclude any privileged communications
16 you had with your lawyers.
17 The question is, how did you arrive
18 at the words that were put in that statement,
19 if you can tell me without disclosing
20 privileged communications?
21 A. I'm not sure that I can.
22 Q. Is the statement that you issued
23 true?
24 A. What do you mean by that?
25 Q. Is the statement that you issued,
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 275 of 465
Page 275
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 the statement that's in front of you, is it a
3 true statement?
4 A. As in that Virginia is a liar?
5 Q. The words you put in there, is that
6 true?
7 A. Of course they're true.
8 Q. When did you become aware that the
9 statement was being released?
10 A. I don't recollect exactly.
11 Q. What day it was?
12 A. No.
13 Q. I'm sorry. Did you identify, I
14 might not have caught it, did you identify
15 the name of the lawyer that you said you
16 retained for purposes of this statement?
17 A. I think .
18 Q. Did you pay that lawyer
19
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Are you aware of any interstate or
22 international transportation of a woman aged
23 18 to 28 for the purposes of prostitution?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
25 form and foundation.

Page 276
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. I'm not sure I even understand your
3 question.
4 Q. I will go slower.
5 Are you aware of any interstate,
6 meaning between states, or international,
7 meaning oversees transportation, of women
8 aged 18 to 28, for the purposes of
9 prostitution?
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
11 form and foundation.
12 A. Are you asking -- I'm still not
13 sure I understand the question.
14 Q. I will try to make it clearer.
15 I'm asking you if you are aware of
16 any interstate, meaning between states, or
17 international transportation, meaning by
18 flight or by car or by train, of women aged
19 18 to 28, their ages are between the ages of
20 18 and 28, for the purposes of prostitution?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
22 form and foundation.
23 A. In the world I'm sure that that
24 happens, I read about it all the time.
25 Q. Not in the world. Are you aware of
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 277 of 465
Page 277
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 it, in your experience with Jeffrey Epstein,
3 of any interstate or international
4 transportation of women aged 18 to 28, for
5 the purposes of prostitution?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
7 form and foundation.
8 A. So whilst I appreciate this might
9 not seem like a smart question, what do you
10 mean by prostitution, what are you asking me
11 exactly?
12 Q. That would be sex for hire, any
13 kind of sexual act that's paid for.
14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
15 form and foundation.
16 A. Who's paying, what are you asking
17 me.
18 Q. It can be paid for by anybody.
19 It's a sexual act that's paid for.
20 I'm asking if you are aware of any
21 interstate or international transportation of
22 women aged 18 to 28, for the purposes of
23 prostitution?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
25 form and foundation.

2 A. I have no idea what you are talking
3 about.
4 Q. So you are not aware of that?
5 A. No.
6 Q. Are you aware of any interstate or
7 international transportation of women, aged
8 18 to 28, for the purposes of having sex with
9 Epstein where they would receive compensation
10 of any type?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
12 form and foundation.
13 A. I don't know what you are referring
14 to.
15 Q. Do you want me to repeat the
16 question?
17 A. Sure, go ahead.
18 Q. Are you aware of any interstate or
19 international transportation of woman, aged
20 18 to 28, for the purpose of having sex with
21 Jeffrey Epstein where they would receive
22 compensation of any type?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
24 and foundation.
25 A. I am not aware of what you are
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 279 of 465
Page 279
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 talking about.
3 Q. Are you aware of any interstate or
4 international transportation of women, aged
5 18 to 28, for the purposes of providing a
6 massage for Jeffrey Epstein?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
8 form and foundation.
9 A. So I you need to repeat that
10 question for me.
11 Q. Sure.
12 Are you aware of any interstate,
13 meaning between states, or international,
14 oversees, transportation of women, aged 18 to
15 28, for the purposes of providing massage for
16 Jeffrey Epstein?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
18 form and foundation.
19 A. I think we can agree he did travel
20 from time to time with a professional adult
21 masseuse.
22 Q. Are you aware of any interstate or
23 international transportation of women, aged
24 18 to 28, for the purposes of providing a
25 massage to any person other than Jeffrey
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 280 of 465
Page 280

2 Epstein?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
4 form and foundation.
5 A. Again, I'm not aware of anybody
6 that, if you are asking for specifics to
7 someone else, I have no knowledge of that.
8 Q. So you are not aware of any
9 interstate or international transportation of
10 a woman aged 18 to 28 for the purposes of
11 providing a massage to any person other than
12 Jeffrey Epstein?
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
14 form and foundation.
15 A. I don't recall what any single
16 person being on a plane for a massage with
17 someone else other than Jeffrey, for the sole
18 purpose, if that's the question, I don't have
19 any recollection of that.
20 Q. Earlier in your testimony, you
21 stated that Virginia Roberts was 17 at the
22 time you met her.
23 How do you know she was 17?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
25 form and foundation. And to the extent
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 281 of 465
Page 281
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 that calls for a privileged response,
3 I'm instructing you not to answer.
4 Q. How do you know Virginia Roberts
5 was 17 at the time you met her?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Again, if you
7 learned that information from your
8 lawyer, I'm instructing you not to
9 answer.
10 A. I will follow my counsel's advice.
11 Q. Are you able to answer that
12 question without telling me information you
13 learned from a lawyer?
14 A. I'm not.
15 Q. So you don't have independent
16 knowledge that Virginia, according to your
17 statement, was 17 at the time you met her?
18 A. Again, my lawyer has instructed me
19 not to answer.
20 Q. I'm asking you a different
21 question. Whether you have any independent
22 knowledge, outside your lawyers, that
23 Virginia was 17 at the time you met her?
24 A. Following the instructions of my
25 lawyers, I can only remember or testify to
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 282 of 465
Page 282
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 what she --
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: She is asking you a
4 different question. She is asking other
5 than what your lawyers have told you, do
6 you have any knowledge about her being
7 17, that's what she is asking.
8 A. I can't recollect where I got all
9 the information that I have that definitively
10 shows that.
11 Q. Earlier in your testimony, I
12 believe you said all of us would know that
13 Virginia was 17 at the time you met her.
14 How would we know that?
15 A. I think you know that by her own
16 dates, now that it was in 2000, so her entire
17 tail of me celebrating her 16th birthday is
18 clearly another giant falsehood.
19 Q. But she was 16 and 17 that year,
20 wasn't she?
21 A. Which year?
22 Q. You said it was 2000.
23 A. I think the information that I have
24 that indicates that definitively was
25 something that is privileged, so I can't
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 283 of 465
Page 283
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 share with you.
3 Q. So you have privileged information
4 that definitively tells you that she was 17
5 at the time you met her?
6 A. I believe I do.
7 Q. How would we know that?
8 A. What are you asking me?
9 Q. Earlier today you testified that we
10 would know that she was 17 at the time that
11 you met her.
12 How would we know that?
13 A. I imagine you have access to
14 exactly the same information that I do.
15 Q. What is that information?
16 A. Again, it's privileged, I can't
17 share it with you but you have been on this
18 case for, I don't know, much much longer than
19 I have and I imagine you have all the
20 information that I do.
21 Q. Do you know whether your lawyers
22 have produced documents from you that would
23 show the age that Virginia was at the time
24 that you met her?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: To the extent that
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 284 of 465
Page 284
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 calls for a communication that you had
3 with one of your lawyers, I'm
4 instructing you not to answer that
5 question.
6 Q. I assume you, as part of the
7 discovery process, had to collect documents
8 that were relevant to this action, is that
9 correct?
10 A. I did.
11 Q. Did you collect documents that
12 would show that Virginia was 17 at the time
13 that you met her?
14 A. I think you have everything that
15 relates, that I had, contemporaneously per
16 what you asked for that I have that relates
17 to that.
18 Q. Did you have a document that
19 identified that Virginia was 17 at the time
20 that you met her?
21 A. You have all of the documents that
22 I had.
23 Q. I'm not asking what documents. I'm
24 asking, do you have a document that
25 identifies Virginia being 17 at the time you
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 285 of 465
Page 285
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 met her?
3 A. You have every document that I
4 have. You have seen every document that I
5 have.
6 Q. That's not what I'm asking.
7 A. I don't recall every document that
8 I gave you, so I don't know. I would have to
9 look at every single document I gave you and
10 then review it but as I recall you have every
11 document that I have.
12 Q. What are you planning to show the
13 jury that will prove that Virginia was 17
14 when you met her?
15 A. Again that's privileged so I can't
16 share that with you.
17 Q. If you're showing the jury, it
18 wouldn't be privileged, so is there a
19 document you have produced in this matter
20 that shows that Virginia was 17 at the time
21 you met her?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: She answered that
23 question already. She said she doesn't
24 know, she has given you everything. If
25 there is a decision -- assuming for the
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 286 of 465

2 moment there is such a document, just
3 hypothetically, and assuming for the
4 moment that it is going to get produced
5 somewhere, if it hasn't already been
6 produced, obviously that would involve a
7 waiver, a future waiver of the
8 privilege. I think that's the answer to
9 the question.
10 Q. Has the document been produced, do
11 you know?
12 A. You have everything that I have
13 given you, so if you can't -- if it's not in
14 those documents, I don't know what to tell
15 you.
16 Q. Your lawyers haven't withheld any
17 documents?
18 A. They are right here. You can ask
19 them.
20 Q. I'm asking you.
21 A. I don't know what -- they're
22 lawyers.
23 Q. When we were talking earlier about

21 is defined as a movable model of a person or

14 telephones. I believe at some point she
15 became a masseuse. I don't recollect when
16 and I personally had massages from
17 Q. What did do for Jeffrey
18 Epstein, did she perform massages, anything
19 else?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. When she came she answered phones
23 and at some point, I believe, I don't have
24 any firm recollection, but I believe she went
25 to school and became a masseuse and I had

2 massages from her.
3 Q. Did you ever have any sexual
4 interaction with her?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
6 and foundation and I'm going to instruct
7 you if we're talking about any
8 consensual adult contact, you are not
9 allowed to answer the question.
10 Q. Did you have any sexual contact
11 with her in the presence of Jeffrey Epstein?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same instruction.
13 Q. Did you have any sexual contact
14 with her in the presence of anybody other
15 than Jeffrey Epstein?
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same instruction.
17 Q. How many massages did you receive
18 from
19 A. I really don't recall but a fair
20 amount.
21 Q. Did the massages involve sex?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm going to
23 instruct you not to answer.
24 Q. Have you ever engaged in sex with
25 any female?

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm going to
3 instruct you not to answer.
4 MS. McCAWLEY: I want the record to
5 reflect that Ms. Maxwell's attorney is
6 directing her not to answer this series
7 of questions.
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: It definitely does.
9 Q. Were you responsible for
10 introducing to Jeffrey Epstein?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
12 form and foundation.
13 A. I already testified that I don't
14 really recall
15 Q. Were you responsible for
16 introducing to Jeffrey Epstein?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
18 form and foundation.
19 A. Again, I don't like the
20 characterization of introduction.
21 came to answer telephones.
22 Q. When did you -- were you the person
23 who brought or introduced or met for
24 purposes of bringing her to Jeffrey Epstein's
25 home?

1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
3 form and foundation.
4 A. That's not how I would characterize
5 that.
6 Q. How would you characterize it?
7 A. I have testified that I'm
8 responsible for finding professional people
9 to work in the homes, age appropriate adult
10 people, so from pool attendants, to
11 gardeners, to chefs, to housekeepers, to
12 butlers, to chauffeurs and one of the
13 functions was to be able to answer the
14 telephones and in the context of finding
15 someone to answer the telephones, I did look
16 to try to find appropriate people to answer
17 the phones.
18 Q. So did you find Johanna for
19 purposes of that role?
20 A. So in the course of looking for
21 somebody to answer phones at the house,
22 Johanna was one of the people who said that
23 she was willing to answer phones.
24 Q. Did you approach her at her school
25 campus?

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
3 and foundation.
4 A. I honestly don't recall how, in
5 that moment, how I met and how she
6 came to get the job but...
7 Q. Did you typically, in your work for
8 Jeffrey Epstein, would you typically go to
9 school campuses to try to find individuals to
10 work for Jeffrey Epstein?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
12 form and foundation.
13 A. I never -- what do you mean by
14 school? Let's characterize school.
15 Q. Any kind of school.
16 A. Obviously not. I never went to any
17 school with young people. I believe
18 came from an adult university, as I would
19 know in England, so university, I went there
20 but I never went, as I best recollect,
21 anywhere else.
22 Q. Did you -- what university was it
23 that you went to?
24 A. I don't recall the university that
25 she went to right now.

2 Q. Would you visit more than one
3 university to try to find individuals to work
4 for Jeffrey Epstein?
5 A. As I recollect, I think that's, in
6 fact, the only university I went to.
7 Q. Did you go there more than once?
8 A. I think I went twice.
9 Q. Who else did you find from that
10 university, was there anybody other than
11
12 A. I don't recollect, I'm sorry.
13 Q. We are going to mark this as
14 Maxwell 13?
15 (Maxwell Exhibit 13, documents,
16 marked for identification.)
17 Q. Can you take a look at the document
18 I put in front of you, please.
19 Are you familiar with this
20 document?
21 A. I'm familiar with this actual
22 document.
23 Q. How was this document created?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
25 form and foundation.

Page 313
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. I don't know how this document was
3 created.
4 Q. You were involved in the creation
5 of this document?
6 A. I think you can see from the date
7 that it's 2004, 2005, so no.
8 Q. You weren't involved in the
9 creation of this document.
10 Did you -- we talked earlier about
11 Mr. Epstein's house, I'm talking about the
12 Palm Beach house where you said there was a
13 computer on the desk, that employees had
14 access to -- people who worked for Jeffrey
15 Epstein may have had access to?
16 A. I think anybody could have had
17 access to that.
18 Q. Was that computer used, if you know
19 to keep a log of addresses and phone contact
20 information for Jeffrey Epstein?
21 A. Are we talking about when this
22 document was created.
23 Q. In general, was there, on that
24 computer during the time that you were
25 present with Jeffrey Epstein, was there a
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 314 of 465
Page 314
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 mechanism by which you kept electronic
3 information of names and addresses of
4 individuals that he knew?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
6 form and foundation.
7 A. I can't testify to what was on that
8 computer or not after I was gone.
9 Q. Not when you were gone, when you
10 were there. If Jeffrey wanted to call, for
11 example, say , would someone be
12 able to go to that computer to pull up the
13 address information and phone contact
14 information for that individual?
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
16 form and foundation.
17 A. I couldn't possibly say.
18 Q. Did you ever have to keep track of
19 address or phone contact information for
20 Jeffrey Epstein?
21 A. That was not my job.
22 Q. Did you ever do it?
23 A. I am not responsible for keeping
24 his numbers so that wasn't my job at all.
25 Q. But did you ever do it? I know
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 315 of 465
Page 315
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 it's not your job but did you ever do it, did
3 you ever keep phone contact information for
4 him?
5 A. During the course of the time we
6 were together, if he gave me a telephone
7 number, I would give it to an assistant to
8 put in the computer, I could do that.
9 Q. Would he ask you for contact
10 information for different individuals, if he
11 wanted to contact someone?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation.
14 A. In the course of the long period of
15 time when I was there, it certainly would be
16 possible for him to ask me for a telephone
17 number and if I had the -- I wouldn't always
18 have it -- I'm sure it happened.
19 Q. Was there a hardcopy book in
20 addition to the computer, a hardcopy book
21 that you could look for numbers that were
22 relevant to Jeffrey Epstein's life and
23 something on the computer or was it just an
24 electronic version?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 316 of 465

2 form and foundation.
3 Q. Was there a hard copy book as well
4 as something on the computer or was there
5 only electronic information on the phone
6 numbers?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
8 form and foundation.
9 A. I can only testify to what I know
10 obviously, and I believe that this is a copy
11 of a stolen document. I would love to know
12 how you guys got it.
13 Q. I'm asking during the time you
14 worked for Jeffrey Epstein, was there a
15 hardcopy document of any kind that kept phone
16 numbers for Jeffrey Epstein, if he needed to
17 contact someone?
18 A. The stolen document I have in front
19 of me that you have is what you are referring
20 to.
21 Q. So there was, during your time when
22 you were there, there was no other, you
23 mentioned there was information on a
24 computer. Was there any hardcopy document
25 that you could refer to to find someone's
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 317 of 465
Page 317
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 number?
3 A. You have the stolen document in
4 front of you.
5 Q. You had access to this when you
6 worked for Jeffrey Epstein?
7 A. This is, I believe, the book that
8 was stolen, that was the hardcopy of whatever
9 was there.
10 Q. So when you were working for
11 Jeffrey Epstein, you were able to access this
12 book?
13 A. This book -- if this is what this
14 is, I believe it was, this is the stolen
15 document from his house.
16 Q. And you were able to access it when
17 you worked for him?
18 A. It was a document that was printed
19 that you could, if you needed to, look for a
20 number.
21 Q. Do you know how this book was
22 created?
23 A. No.
24 Q. When you referred to it a moment
25 ago, to a stolen document, when
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 318 of 465
Page 318
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 turned this document over to the
3 FBI, are you aware he described it as a
4 document that came from your computer?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
6 form and foundation.
7 A. I have no idea what he said or
8 didn't say, so if you want me to reference
9 something he said, you need to show it to me.
10 Q. Did you keep this document, an
11 electronic copy of it, on your personal
12 computer?
13 A. I don't recollect.
14 Q. If you had to update something, for
15 example, if there was a new number, a new
16 individual that Jeffrey had hired that you
17 were going to track, would you input that
18 information into this document on your
19 computer?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. I've already testified that I'm not
23 responsible for updating and keeping these
24 records.
25 Q. Did you have this document on your
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 319 of 465
Page 319
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 computer, your personal computer?
3 A. I told you, I don't recollect
4 having this document on my computer.
5 Q. Do you know what computers this
6 document was on, if more than one?
7 A. I'm sorry, this is a long time ago
8 and I don't recall exactly how this was all
9 managed.
10 Q. If you didn't create this document,
11 do you know who did?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation.
14 A. I don't.
15 Q. I'm going to direct your attention
16 to part of this document. It's towards the
17 back, it's going to be page 91 and it has
18 bates label Giuffre 001663. I'm going to
19 direct your attention to the section that
20 says, Massage Florida.
21 Did you input any of the names or
22 numbers under that section?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
24 and foundation.
25 A. So this document is produced in
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 320 of 465
Page 320
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 2004, 2005, so, no.
3 Q. But I'm sorry, correct me if I'm
4 misunderstanding your testimony, I thought
5 you said when you were working with Jeffrey,
6 that this document existed and it was
7 something you utilized?
8 A. I can't possibly tell you what
9 numbers were added or not added subsequent to
10 my departure.
11 Q. So you can't recall if you added
12 any of these numbers?
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
14 form and foundation, mischaracterizes
15 the witness' testimony.
16 Q. Are there any numbers on here or
17 names that you recognize that you would have
18 entered into this section?
19 A. I already testified that I'm not
20 responsible for inputting numbers and names
21 into this so I would not be able to tell you.
22 Q. Are there any names or numbers
23 under this section, Massage Florida, that you
24 would have provided to an assistant to input
25 into this document?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 321 of 465
Page 321
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. I can't possibly say.
3 Q. Do you see under Massage Florida,
4 about halfway down the first column, do you
5 see a number that says cell?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: What page?
7 Q. It's 91, Bates number 001663.
8 About halfway down, it says in the first
9 column, it says cell.
10 Do you see that?
11 A. I do.
12 Q. Would you have provided after, I
13 know you didn't hire her, Jeffrey hired her
14 but after you brought her to Jeffrey, would
15 you have given her cell phone number to an
16 assistant to input into this document?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
18 and foundation.
19 A. I didn't bring her to Jeffrey, the
20 way you characterize and I would have no
21 knowledge of how this number ended up in this
22 book.
23 Q. I believe you, and I will try to
24 use your words so we are clear, you met
25 is that correct?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 322 of 465
Page 322
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And then she began working for
4 Jeffrey?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Would you have provided whomever
7 was in charge of keeping this updated with
8 cell number so you would be able to
9 contact her if needed?
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
11 form and foundation.
12 A. I don't know. It could have been a
13 number of different ways, it it could have
14 been Jeffrey who gave it to somebody.
15 Q. You just don't remember doing that?
16 A. I do not.
17 Q. Now, as you look -- I want you to
18 take a look at the Florida massage list, it's
19 three columns there.
20 Do you, as you look at those names
21 on the various columns, do you know the ages
22 of any of the girls in this list?
23 A. I don't know. One, I don't know
24 who all the people are on this list and I
25 certainly don't know the ages.

1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. Do you know what their
3 qualifications are?
4 A. I don't know who the people are in
5 general so of course I don't know what their
6 qualifications are.
7 Q. Do you know why Jeffrey has so many
8 masseuses listed in Florida in his book here?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
10 form and foundation.
11 A. Again, this book was created post
12 my departure, so I couldn't explain why all
13 these people were here.
14 Q. When you were there, you said this
15 book existed?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. So when you were there, were there
18 a number of masseuses listed under the
19 Florida massage?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation and
22 mischaracterization of the witness'
23 testimony.
24 Q. I'm asking you a question.
25 When you were there, were there a
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 324 of 465
Page 324
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 number of masseuses listed under the Florida
3 massage section?
4 A. When I was there, I would have, of
5 course there would have been some masseuses
6 listed but I could not tell you who or how
7 many and this -- I could not possibly because
8 I wouldn't remember.
9 Q. Do you know why Jeffrey would have
10 had so many names listed under his massage
11 Florida?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
13 and foundation.
14 A. I can't testify to why Jeffrey has
15 so many.
16 Q. Did he use a different masseuse
17 every day?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
19 form and foundation.
20 Q. You can answer.
21 A. When I was there he had a massage
22 roughly every day, one masseuse, and mostly
23 he would have them at random times, so it
24 would be difficult if you just only had one
25 person, man, woman, for an adult massage, to
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 325 of 465
Page 325
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 come and be available for whatever time it
3 was. So he would have more than one person
4 that he could call for a massage because at
5 any given time the one that he called first
6 may not have been available.
7 Q. So would it typically be a
8 different person each day that would give him
9 a massage?
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
11 form and foundation.
12 A. It would be, when I was there,
13 based on availability.
14 Q. Would it surprise you to learn that
15 the Federal Government found that some of the
16 girls on this list under massage Florida were
17 under the age of 18?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
19 form and foundation.
20 A. I can't testify to what the
21 government found or did not find because I
22 would have no knowledge of it.
23 Q. I'm asking if you would be
24 surprised by that?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Form and foundation.

2 A. I have knowledge of it. I can't
3 speculate.
4 Q. On the second column, towards the
5 bottom, there is the name, it's one up from
6 the bottom, there is the name ,
7 do you know ?
8 A. I do.
9 Q. Who is she?
10 A. She was a friend of Jeffrey's.
11 Q. Is she a masseuse?
12 A. She, I don't think she was a
13 masseuse, no.
14 Q. Why would be she listed under
15 Florida massages?
16 A. An input error.
17 Q. Is this list any individual that
18 would have sex with Jeffrey?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
20 form and foundation.
21 A. I wouldn't have any knowledge of
22 that.
23 Q. Do you know if Jeffrey had sex with
24 ?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form

2 and foundation.
3 A. First of all, I wouldn't have any
4 knowledge of that.
5 MS. McCAWLEY: We are going to take
6 a quick break.
7 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: It's now 4:39
8 and we are off the record.
9 (Recess.)
10 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: It's now 4:54
11 and we are as back on the record
12 starting disk number 8.
13 Q. Ms. Maxwell, we were talking
14 earlier about the journal and I believe you
15 said in 2004, 2005, you were no longer
16 working and responsible for that journal, is
17 that correct?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
19 form and foundation.
20 A. What are we referring to, this
21 document right here?
22 Q. Yes.
23 A. I don't know who is the author of
24 this or I can't tell you what is in here
25 versus what would have been here when I was

2 around. I can't testify to that.
3 Q. Were you around in 2004, 2005?
4 A. I already testified that I was
5 there when Jeffrey's mother passed away and
6 so you know, I did visit for her passing and
7 I believe I was there for a couple of days in
8 2005.
9 Q. So if an employee of Mr. Epstein in
10 2004 said that you were the employee's direct
11 supervisor, would that be incorrect?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
13 and foundation.
14 A. What employee, what's the
15 circumstances and what is the story, I don't
16 know what you are asking me.
17 Q. If said in 2004
18 when he was hired, you were his direct
19 supervisor, would that be true?
20 A. No.
21 Q. Were you in 2004 supervising
22
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
24 and foundation.
25 A. I never supervised .

18 document?

2 have a computer that was your computer
3 located in Jeffrey Epstein's home?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form

9 Q. So is telling the
10 truth when he says that he downloaded that
11 book from your computer?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

14 A. I couldn't possibly tell you what
15 did or didn't do or said or didn't
16 say.

19 where this document came from.
20 Q. Did you have a list of names of
21 individuals with contact information for

2 of this document being on it, so I don't know
3 where this came from.

5 house that you're referencing. On a personal
6 computer of yours, did you have that
7 document?
8 A. I don't know where this document
9 came from, so I can't possibly say this
10 document was on any computer that I may have
11 had access to.
12 Q. On a personal computer of your own,
13 did you have lists of the phone numbers and
14 contact information relating to Jeffrey
15 Epstein?

17 book but I can't possibly testify to where
18 this thing came from.
19 Q. Was it your address book or was it
20 addresses that related to Jeffrey Epstein?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

2 address book with individuals you knew or was
3 it an address book for your employer, Jeffrey
4 Epstein?
5 A. Jeffrey has his situation and I
6 have no -- this is Jeffrey's, it came from
7 his home, so I can't testify to anything
8 about this in that period of time.
9 Q. So you didn't have on your computer
10 a list of contact information for individuals
11 that was related to Jeffrey Epstein?
12 A. I don't recall exactly what I had
13 back in 2004 and 2005, so I can't say what I
14 had back then that relates to his addresses,
15 I can't recall.
16 Q. So is it possible that someone
17 could have downloaded from your personal
18 computer a list of names and address that

2 addresses affiliated with Jeffrey Epstein
3 from your computer?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

10 testimony from deposition
11 and it's on page 370 and I want to ask you a
12 question about it, if it's true or false?
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm going to object
14 unless you show the witness the
15 document.
16 MS. McCAWLEY: I will pass it. We
17 are not going to mark it. We will skip
18 it.

12 going to disclose that Jeffrey Epstein was
13 trafficking underage girls?
14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
15 form and foundation.
16 A. First of all, there are so many
17 things wrong with that question, but I have
18 no knowledge of what you are talking about.
19 Q. Have you ever contacted or
20 instructed anyone to contact any witness in
21 this case for the purposes of threatening
22 them not to testify in this case?

12 female to become pregnant and carry his baby

17 will not testify for anything for Jeffrey.

12 Q. Do you still have that car?
13 A. I don't.

3 said you paid that back, correct?
4 A. That's my testimony.
5 Q. Anything else in excess of $50,000

8 recall any gifts really.
9 Q. When is the last time Jeffrey
10 Epstein gave you a gift in excess of $50,000?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Assumes facts not in

16 purchasing a gift for you?

4 police report relating to Virginia Roberts?
5 A. I believe I've read a report in the

7 Q. Did you provide the press with a
8 report on a grand theft by Virginia Roberts?
9 A. I don't know how the press got that
10 story.
11 Q. Do you know if Virginia Roberts
12 committed a grand theft?
13 A. I only know what I read in the
14 press.
15 Q. Did you ever state to the press
16 that Virginia Roberts committed a grand
17 theft?
18 A. I've never had any conversation
19 directly with press.
20 Q. Did any of your representatives
21 ever inform the press that Virginia Roberts
22 committed a grand theft?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 345 of 465
Page 345
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 representatives said to press or didn't.
3 Q. Did they ever discuss with you the
4 fact that they were going to report that
5 Virginia Roberts participated in a grand
6 theft?
7 A. I don't know how, first of all, I
8 don't know how I know that. I believe I read
9 it in a press report so...
10 Q. I'm going to mark this as composite
11 exhibit, Maxwell 14 please?
12 (Maxwell Exhibit 14, email, marked
13 for identification.)
14 Q. I'm going to direct you to page GM
15 00109. At the top of that page you are going
16 to see an email address from Jeffrey Epstein
17 on Sunday June 12, 2011 to
18
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. The re line says, This is the
21 actual version they wanted me to send which I
22 changed but this is back from my U.K.
23 lawyers.
24 Do you see that?
25 A. Yes.

Page 346
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Q. If you go down further, you're
3 going to see halfway through the page, you
4 will see your email address the
5 and you will see a statement that says, Thank
6 you. I have it now. I'm working on the
7 letter a little. I will send final version
8 tomorrow and whatever is in it will be
9 factually accurate.
10 Beneath that you will see
11 who I believe you identified earlier
12 as one of your attorneys?
13 A. Uh-huh.
14 Q. And you will see a letter, starting
15 the text of a letter starting, I want you to
16 turn to the second page which is GM 00110.
17 About halfway through the page, it says you
18 will also presumably draw attention to the
19 fact that prior to filing her suit against
20 Mr. Epstein, Ms. Roberts fled the U.S. to
21 avoid being arrested for grand theft. Police
22 report available.
23 What grand theft were you referring
24 to there that Virginia Roberts committed?

2 form and foundation.
3 A. I don't know. However, I believe
4 she stole money from somewhere where she
5 worked.
6 Q. How do you know that was grand
7 theft?
8 A. I don't know how I know that.
9 Q. So you authorized a statement that
10 characterized that as grand theft without
11 knowing whether it was grand theft?
12 A. What month, what is the date of
13 this?
14 Q. The date of this is June 12, 2011?
15 A. So I'm afraid such a long time ago,
16 I'm not sure how, I really couldn't testify
17 as to how that language ended up in here.
18 Q. Do you have the police report? It
19 says police report available. Do you have
20 that document?
21 A. I don't have that document.
22 Q. Who does?
23 A. I have no idea.
24 Q. Would your lawyer
25 have that document?

1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. I don't know who has this document.
3 Q. What's your basis in that statement
4 for saying Ms. Roberts fled the U.S.?
5 A. Again, you are asking me for a
6 statement that I made in 2011 and I can't say
7 what in 2011 exactly the basis of that
8 statement was.
9 Q. So you don't know whether or not
10 that statement is true?
11 A. This is in 2011 and it never went
12 out, so I'm not sure exactly.
13 Q. But you said in your email that you
14 were working to make it factually accurate,
15 is that correct?
16 A. That's what it says.
17 Q. I'm going to mark as Maxwell 15 a
18 document dated February 24, 2015?
19 (Maxwell Exhibit 15, email, marked
20 for identification.)
21 Q. This is an email from who
22 you've identified as your on
23 February 24, 2015 to which I understand
24 to be your email address and .
25 The subject line says, VR cried rape. Prior

2 case dismissed as prosecutors found her not
3 credible. The message says, Ghislaine, some
4 helpful leakage, dot dot dot. What is it you
5 were leaking to the press?
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection, there is
7 no foundation that she leaked anything
8 and you know that.
9 Q. What was it that you were leaking
10 to the press in that statement?
11 A. Again, I don't think that's
12 referring to that, that's just referring to
13 the press getting hold of whatever story it
14 is.
15 Q. What was leaking to the
16 press?
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
18 and foundation.
19 A. It doesn't say was leaking
20 anything. It doesn't say that.
21 Q. The statement says, helpful
22 leakage, is that correct?
23 A. It says helpful leakage. That
24 doesn't mean he leaked anything.
25 Q. Did you leak to the press
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 350 of 465

2 information to the press information about
3 the subject line, VR cried rape, prior case
4 dismissed as prosecutors found her not
5 credible?
6 A. I don't no idea what is
7 referring to. I think he is referring to the
8 press held the story. I couldn't testify to
9 that.
10 Q. Did you leak to the press
11 information regarding the statement, VR cried
12 rape prior case dismissed as prosecutors
13 found her not credible, either through you or
14 through ?
15 A. I think this is coming from the
16 daily mail.
17 Q. That is not my question, I'm asking
18 whether you or leaked that?
19 A. I have no knowledge, I have no
20 idea, I'm sorry. I can't -- I have no
21 recollection. I have no idea what she is
22 talking about.
23 Q. I'm going to mark this as 16?

2 Q. This is an email addressed at the
3 top from Jeffrey Epstein on Monday, January
4 12, 2015 to which I understand to be
5 your email address. The email reads, You can
6 issue a reward to any of Virginia's friends,
7 aquaints, family, that come forward to help
8 prove her allegations are false. The
9 strongest is the dinner and the new
10 version of the Virgin Islands that
11 practiced in an underage orgy.
12 Did you offer any rewards to
13 Virginia's family or friends to contradict
14 Virginia's story?
15 A. Absolutely not.
16 Q. Did Jeffrey Epstein offer any
17 rewards to any of Virginia's, as he suggests
18 here, friends, family or acquaintances to
19 contradict Virginia's story?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation.
22 A. I have no idea what he did.
23 Q. Did he tell he was going to offer
24 rewards to Virginia's acquaintances, friends
25 and family to prove her allegations were

2 false?
3 A. He did not.
4 Q. Do you know whether Jeffrey Epstein
5 paid to give testimony about
6 Virginia Roberts?
7 A. I don't know who is.
8 Q. So you don't know whether Jeffrey
9 Epstein paid her?
10 A. I don't know who is.
11 Q. Have you ever contacted any of
12 Virginia's friends, acquaintances or family
13 regarding this case?
14 A. I don't know who Virginia's friends
15 or family are and I have not contacted
16 anybody related to her in any way, shape or
17 form.
18 Q. I will turn you, I believe it's the
19 thicker document which is Maxwell, I believe
20 it was 14, right there, the compilation
21 document to GM, at the bottom, GM 00071. You
22 actually may want to turn to the prior page
23 70 so you can see the email chain. At the
24 top of the page --
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't have a 00071

2 on mine.
3 MS. McCAWLEY: It's the second page
4 in that document.
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay.
6 Q. It's dated Friday March 11, 2011
7 from Maxwell to Jeffrey with the title, Daily
8 Mail and there is a forward from to
9 you and a number of other individuals, that's
10 on the cover page and as you scroll to the
11 second page, you are going to see that part
12 of the chain that I'm asking about and that
13 is the chain at the bottom which is dated
14 3/10/2011 from and it says we
15 think -- we should think about the letter to
16 the editor. School can be university. Age
17 of consent in Florida is complex. See below,
18 if you are 16 years old, a sexual
19 relationship with someone between 18 and 24
20 is legal in Florida. Two persons between 16
21 and 24, Florida statute 794.05. A person 24
22 years or of age or older who engages in
23 sexual activity with a person 16 or 17 years
24 of age commits a felony in the second degree.
25 So as soon as you turn 16 you are able to

2 have sexual relations and you can have sexual
3 relations with a minor under the age of 18
4 until your 24th birthday.
5 Why were you concerned with the age
6 of consent in Florida?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
8 form and foundation of the question.
9 A. I wasn't concerned. I think this
10 was somebody sending me the statute for
11 informational purposes.
12 Q. Who is ?
13 A. He is the person who,
14 boss I believe, I don't know what the
15 relationship is.
16 Q. I didn't hear you?
17 A. I I'm not
18 sure exactly.
19 Q. Why would he be sending you
20 information addressing concerns about the age
21 of consent in Florida?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
23 form and foundation.
24 A. I think he was just trying to be --
25 telling me details that would happen,

2 Virginia in '11 was claiming she was 15 and
3 we thought she was 17. I didn't know what
4 the statutes were in Florida and I think he
5 was just trying to be helpful so I would
6 know.
7 Q. Did you have a concern that you had
8 violated this statute in Florida?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
10 form and foundation.
11 A. No.
12 Q. Did you have a concern that Jeffrey
13 Epstein had violated this statute in Florida?
14 A. I'm not concerned what happened
15 with Jeffrey. I'm only concerned what
16 happens with me.
17 Q. Why did you communicate with
18 about the sexual consent age in
19 Florida?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation. It misstates her
22 testimony.
23 A. I wasn't concerned. I think he was
24 being helpful and stating what the statute
25 was.

2 Q. I'm going to turn you now in that
3 same stack the Bates number GM 00088. At the
4 top of the email you are going to see Jeffrey
5 Epstein, dated June 8, 2011, to you and it's
6 got a re line, Vanity Fair. If you go down
7 the chain you will see where it says under
8 your email, Do you have a problem with
9 anything I said.
10 Were you communicating with Jeffrey
11 to confirm what statements you could put in
12 any press releases you were given?
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
14 form and foundation.
15 A. Any interest I have is in accuracy.
16 Q. Were you confirming with Jeffrey
17 Epstein what information you could put in
18 press releases?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
20 form and foundation.
21 A. Again, I'm only looking for
22 accuracy.
23 Q. Why would you ask him if he had a
24 problem with anything you were saying?
25 A. If there is anything I
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 357 of 465
Page 357
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 characterized that was not correct.
3 Q. That's not what you said. You
4 said, do you have a problem with anything I
5 said.
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
7 form and foundation. There is no
8 question pending.
9 MS. McCAWLEY: There is.
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: That's not a
11 question, it's a statement.
12 MS. McCAWLEY: Don't interrupt me.
13 Q. Di you say, do you have a problem
14 with anything I said?
15 A. That was asking in my parlance that
16 I wanted him to check it for accuracy.
17 Q. Did he tell you there was anything
18 inaccurate about the statement?
19 A. Again, I have to read the whole
20 thing to figure that out.
21 Q. Were you coordinating with Jeffrey
22 Epstein during this time period in 2011
23 regarding statements that you were issuing to
24 the press?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Did you withdraw the
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 358 of 465
Page 358
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 last question.
3 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm not withdrawing
4 anything. I'm asking a question.
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: There was a question
6 pending. You didn't let the witness
7 answer the question, then you moved on
8 to another question so I'm asking for
9 clarification for the record now which
10 question are we answering.
11 MS. McCAWLEY: There is an answer.
12 The question was did he tell you
13 anything, there was anything in the
14 statement inaccurate about the statement
15 and she said again, I read the whole
16 thing --
17 THE WITNESS: I would have to.
18 MS. McCAWLELY: -- I would have to
19 read the whole thing to figure that out.
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Then she started
21 reading it and you asked another
22 question.
23 MS. McCAWLEY: That's the question.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm wondering if its
25 still pending.

2 MS. McCAWLEY: It was answered.
3 Q. Were you coordinating with Jeffrey
4 Epstein during the time period in 2011
5 regarding the statements you were issuing to
6 the press?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
8 form and foundation.
9 A. I only wanted to be accurate in any
10 factual statements that I made.
11 Q. You knew at that time that Jeffrey
12 Epstein had been convicted for sexual abuse
13 of a minor, is that correct?
14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form
15 and foundation.
16 A. He was sentenced I believe for
17 underage -- soliciting an underaged
18 prostitute.
19 Q. You knew that he was a registered
20 sex offender?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. You were coordinating with him the
23 statement that you were going to be making to
24 the press to confirm whether they were
25 accurate in your words?

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
3 form and foundation.
4 A. I was not coordinating with
5 Jeffrey. He had details that I did not have.
6 I was not party to his case. I needed to
7 have information in order to be able to
8 respond so I was not coordinating with him.
9 I was merely asking for details that I could
10 have.
11 Q. Did Jeffrey write any of your press
12 statements for you?
13 A. No.
14 Q. He didn't draft any of them?
15 A. I have a lawyer who was working on
16 this and that was -- I asked, I believe as I
17 recollect asked him for information to make
18 sure I was being accurate in the
19 representations for whatever I was
20 discussing.
21 Q. Did Jeffrey provide you with any
22 drafts of statements to provide to the press?
23 A. I only recall drafts from my
24 lawyer.
25 Q. I will mark this as Maxwell 17.

2 (Maxwell Exhibit 17, email, marked
3 for identification.)
4 Q. This is an email from you on
5 January 10, 2015 to
6 The statement you had before you
7 earlier, that, if you can pull that in front
8 of you, the one page press release that you
9 gave. You might know from memory.
10 Was the press release that you
11 issued with the statement about Virginia
12 issued in or around January 2, 2015?
13 A. As best as I can recollect.
14 Q. I want to turn your attention to
15 the document I just handed you which is Bates
16 No. 001044, from you to
17 It says in the first sentence, I'm
18 out of my depth to understand defamation,
19 other legal hazards and I don't want to end
20 up in a lawsuit aimed at me from anyone, if I
21 can help it. Apparently, even saying
22 Virginia is a liar has hazards.
23 You knew at the time you called
24 Virginia a liar in early January of 2015 that
25 that was something that would result in a
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 362 of 465
Page 362
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 lawsuit, is that correct?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
4 form and foundation.
5 A. I have legal advice that I took.
6 Q. But you knew in early January by
7 making a statement calling Virginia a liar
8 that you were subjecting yourself to a legal
9 dispute with her?
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
11 form and foundation.
12 A. I took legal advice as to what
13 should be said and not be said and the legal
14 advice that came from the United Kingdom
15 was --
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: You are not allowed
17 to talk about any legal advice that you
18 got from anybody that's a lawyer.
19 A. Sorry.
20 Q. So is it correct without telling me
21 what you talked to your lawyers about that
22 you knew because this is dated January 10
23 that when you made this statement in early
24 January, January 2 of 2015 you knew that
25 calling Virginia a liar would subject you to
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 363 of 465
Page 363

2 a legal action, isn't that correct?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
4 form and foundation. As to what you
5 knew -- whatever she knows would be
6 privileged.
7 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm asking if she
8 knows. I'm not asking her to tell me
9 about her privileged communications.
10 A. All I can say is I asked a question
11 and received legal advice.
12 (Maxwell Exhibit 18, email, marked
13 for identification.)
14 Q. This is an email dated January 15,
15 2015 from Jeffrey Epstein to you?
16 A. Uh-huh.
17 Q. It states in the first line, do you
18 want to come out and say she was the
19 girlfriend during the time?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
21 form and foundation of the question and
22 actually the word is , there
23 is no vowel in there.
24 MS. McCAWLEY: I was just trying to
25 pronounce it.

2 Q. This email reads do you want
3 without a vowel, to come out and say
4 she was the girlfriend during the time.
5 Who was Jeffrey Epstein referring
6 to?
7 A. I believe he was referring to
8 .
9 Q. Why was he asking you if you wanted
10 to come out and say she was the
11 girlfriend?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
13 form and foundation.
14 A. The way the press and you were
15 characterizing me is I was with Jeffrey
16 throughout this entire period of time and I
17 was not.
18 Q. Was with Jeffrey during this
19 period of time?
20 A. I believe she was.
21 Q. Did Jeffrey come out and tell the
22 press it was and not you that was with
23 him as he is proposing here?
24 A. I don't believe he did.
25 Q. Did you want him to do that?
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 365 of 465
Page 365
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 A. No, I didn't ask him to do
3 anything. No.
4 Q. So do you know in January of 2015,
5 was his girlfriend?
6 A. 2015, I have no idea who was his
7 girlfriend in 2015.
8 Q. I'm sorry, you are correct.
9 In the period of 1999 to 2002, was
10 his girlfriend?
11 A. They spent a lot of time together.
12 Q. Did you talk to about going
13 to the press and saying that she was the
14 girlfriend and not you?
15 A. I have never spoken to
16 Q. Was offered any money to
17 make a statement that she was the girlfriend?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
19 form and foundation.
20 A. I have no idea. I have never
21 spoken to and I don't know anything --
22 I have no idea.

2 Maxwell dated January 25, 2015.
3 A. Uh-huh.
4 Q. I will direct your attention to the
5 bottom email which is from you on Saturday
6 January 24, 2015. It says, I would
7 appreciate it if would come out and
8 say she was your girlfriend. I think she was
9 from the end of '99 to 2002.
10 Does that refresh your recollection
11 that you asked Jeffrey to have come
12 out and say she was his girlfriend?
13 A. I'm sure I would loved anybody to
14 come out and say they were with Jeffrey
15 rather than me.
16 Q. Was that an accurate statement you
17 were asking to be made to the press?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
19 form and foundation.
20 A. When is this?
21 Q. 2015. The statement is whether she
22 was the girlfriend from '99 to 2002. As the
23 email reads.
24 A. What is your question?
25 Q. My question is, was that an
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 367 of 465
Page 367
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 accurate statement you were going to be
3 giving to the press?
4 A. I didn't make the statement and
5 never came out, so it's completely
6 moot.
7 Q. My question is, was it an accurate
8 statement that was the girlfriend from
9 '99 to 2002 or were you just making that up
10 for purposes of deflecting press from you?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
12 form and foundation.
13 A. As I said they spent a lot of time
14 together and...
15 Q. Were you also his girlfriend from
16 '99 to 2002?
17 A. I don't if I would have ever
18 characterized myself as his girlfriend, but
19 at that time, was with him as much if
20 not more than I was.
21 Q. I will mark this as Maxwell 20?
22 (Maxwell Exhibit 20, email, marked
23 for identification.)
24 Q. This is an email at the top, it's
25 Bates labled 001060. At the top is a chain

2 from Jeffrey to you on January 11, 2015 and
3 if you look below, I'm going to start at the
4 bottom of that chain which is January 11 at
5 9:15 from Jeffrey and he wrote, do you
6 have an article coming out in Monday's paper.
7 If so, could you please forward us a copy.
8 Do you know what Jeffrey was
9 referring to there?
10 A. I don't know.
11 Q. If you look up in the email chain
12 do you see an email address from
13 responding to that letter?
14 A. I do.
15 Q. So that would be
16 that Jeffrey was emailing at that time
17 according to this chain, correct?
18 A. It certainly looks like it.
19 Q. The email from to Jeffrey is,
20 Nothing on Monday. I'm working on several
21 possible articles about unfairness in the
22 legal process that allows false charges to be
23 inserted into legal documents with no
24 opportunity to respond.
25 And do you see above that Jeffrey's

13 and foundation.
14 A. I can't possibly know.
15 Q. Did you discuss with him why he
16 told you to be careful?
17 A. I had limited contact with him. I
18 don't recall where this goes in the chain,
19 why he was telling me to be careful, I have
20 no idea.
21 Q. Did you respond to this email?
22 A. If you don't have it, I didn't
23 respond.
24 Q. Did you ever delete emails during
25 the period of January of 2015?

3 for in discovery, that I have I gave you.
4 Q. That's not my question.
5 Did you ever delete emails in
6 January of 2015?
7 A. I have not deleted anything that
8 you have asked me for in discovery. I have
9 given you everything that I have.
10 Q. That is not my question, my
11 question is, did you ever delete emails in
12 January of 2015?
13 A. In the normal course of my work,
14 there are emails from spam that I delete.
15 That is the type of email I've deleted.
16 Anything that is material to what you want, I
17 have not deleted.
18 Q. How do you know that?
19 A. Well, anybody that's to do with
20 Jeffrey or or women or anything of which
21 I know you were interested in, of which I
22 have anything I would not have done because I
23 don't want to subject myself to...

2 Q. Earlier today, you said you were in

11 Q. Ms. Maxwell, do you recall being
12 subpoenaed for a deposition back in 2009?
13 A. I do.
14 Q. Why did you avoid giving your
15 deposition in that case when you were
16 subpoenaed and had the opportunity to tell
17 your side of the story?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
19 form and foundation.
20 A. That's not what happened.
21 Q. What happened?
22 A. As I best recall, I was subpoenaed
23 and a date was set for the subpoena and
24 everything was set and I believe it was with
25 Brad Edwards, correct me if I'm wrong, and
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 374 of 465
Page 374

2 Brad Edwards failed to show up for the
3 subpoena.
4 Q. So your testimony is Brad Edwards
5 did not show up for the deposition that had
6 been set?
7 A. Correct.
8 Q. Did you give any statement that
9 your mother was ill and, therefore, you
10 couldn't take your deposition and had to
11 leave the country indefinitely?
12 A. That's an entirely separate
13 situation. Brad Edwards was involved in the
14 , I
15 believe, you know, is when fake suits were
16 created in Jeffrey's case and
 and Brad Edwards worked
18 for that firm.
19 Q. And Mr. Edwards worked for that
20 firm?
21 A. So when the subpoena came, Brad
22 Edwards was involved with in the
23 case so when I was called for subpoena, then
24 and I had a subpoena, date and time set, Brad
25 Edwards went AWAL, meaning he failed to
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 375 of 465
Page 375
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 respond to calls and failed to get in touch
3 with my attorneys, even though a date and
4 time was set for the subpoena and so that's
5 what happened to that subpoena. It just
6 didn't happen.
7 Q. We may be talking about two
8 different cases so I will ask the question
9 again.
10 Was there ever a time where you
11 were subpoenaed to sit for a deposition that
12 you could not make it because you said that
13 your mother was ill?
14 A. So that is the same subpoena that
15 Brad Edwards failed to turn up for and then I
16 think five or six months passed between -- a
17 period of time, I can't characterize it
18 exactly, a period of time passed where then
19 he resurfaced and asked for a new subpoena to
20 be -- a new time to be set and because he had
21 contacted the press and done all sorts of
22 things that you guys are familiar with, I
23 believe, it was my lawyer suggested that I
24 should have some sort of protective order and
25 I believe between the time for when Brad
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1137-13 Filed 10/22/20 Page 376 of 465
Page 376
1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 Edwards resurfaced after the
 for
4 creating fake cases in Jeffrey's and other
5 people's cases, in between the time when
6 there were -- trying to figure out the
7 protective situation for me, my mother was
8 sick, she is 89, she was 89 at that time so I
9 -- they -- we can all -- we all have parents,
10 so anyone, I don't know how old your parents
11 are but any parent or godparent, any
12 individual who is in the late 80s 90s, we can
13 understand has health issues so my mother's
14 health was deteriorating very rapidly at that
15 time and we had issues at home with who she
16 would talk to and how to manage her, her
17 healthcare situation and so I went home.
18 They were still arguing about the protective
19 order --
20 Q. Is it your testimony that there was
21 not a date set for your deposition at the
22 time you left to go see your mother?
23 A. I don't believe so.
24 Q. Are you friends with the
25 A. I am.

2 Q. Did you attend a wedding of
3 a few weeks after the date was set,

8 don't remember the exact timing of that, so
9 I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?
10 Q. Did you come back to the United
11 States to attend wedding?
12 A. I attended
13 wedding but I don't know if I came back

16 logs earlier, there was a flight where you
17 ended up in , I believe it was

21 document.

2 had to do to get clearance to land at that
3 naval base.
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: If you need to look
5 at something to answer the question, you
6 can. If you can't answer the question

17 surround this, this is what we were given.

13 statement.
14 MS. McCAWLEY: Jeffrey is writing
